Transcriber&rsquo;s Note:<br /><br />

    In this work, all spellings and punctuation were
    reproduced from the original work except in the very few
    cases where an obvious typo occurred. These typos are
    corrected without comment. <br /><br />

    In the original volumes in this set, each even-numbered
    page had a header consisting of the page number, the
    volume title, and the chapter number. The odd-numbered
    page header consisted of the year of the diary entry, a
    subject phrase, and the page number. In this set of
    e-books, the year is included as part of the date (which
    in the original volume were in the form reproduced here,
    minus the year). The subject phrase has been converted to
    sidenotes located below the relevant page number. <br /><br />

    In the original book set, consisting of three volumes,
    the master index was in Volume 3. In this set of e-books,
    the index has been duplicated into each of the other

<h2>1830.</h2>

<h3>London, July 16th, 1830</h3>

<p>I returned here on the 6th of this
month, and have waited these ten days to look about me
and see and hear what is passing. The present King and
his proceedings occupy all attention, and nobody thinks
any more of the late King than if he had been dead fifty
years, unless it be to abuse him and to rake up all his vices
and misdeeds. Never was elevation like that of King
William IV. His life has been hitherto passed in obscurity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
and neglect, in miserable poverty, surrounded by a numerous
progeny of bastards, without consideration or friends, and
he was ridiculous from his grotesque ways and little meddling
curiosity. Nobody ever invited him into their house, or
thought it necessary to honour him with any mark of attention
or respect; and so he went on for above forty years, till
Canning brought him into notice by making him Lord High
Admiral at the time of his grand Ministerial schism. In
that post he distinguished himself by making absurd speeches,
by a morbid official activity, and by a general wildness which
was thought to indicate incipient insanity, till shortly after
Canning&rsquo;s death and the Duke&rsquo;s accession, as is well known,
the latter dismissed him. He then dropped back into
obscurity, but had become by this time somewhat more of
a personage than he was before. His brief administration
of the navy, the death of the Duke of York, which made him
heir to the throne, his increased wealth and regular habits,
had procured him more consideration, though not a great
deal. Such was his position when George IV. broke all at
once, and after three months of expectation William finds
himself King.</p>

<h3>July 18th, 1830</h3>

<p>King George had not been dead three days
before everybody discovered that he was no loss, and King
William a great gain. Certainly nobody ever was less
regretted than the late King, and the breath was hardly out
of his body before the press burst forth in full cry against
him, and raked up all his vices, follies, and misdeeds, which
were numerous and glaring enough.</p>

<p>The new King began very well. Everybody expected he
would keep the Ministers in office, but he threw himself
into the arms of the Duke of Wellington with the strongest
expressions of confidence and esteem. He proposed to all
the Household, as well as to the members of Government, to
keep their places, which they all did except Lord Conyngham
and the Duke of Montrose. He soon after, however, dismissed
most of the equerries, that he might fill their places
with the members of his own family. Of course such a King
wanted not due praise, and plenty of anecdotes were raked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">KING WILLIAM&rsquo;S ACCESSION.</span>
up of his former generosities and kindnesses. His first
speech to the Council was well enough given, but his burlesque
character began even then to show itself. Nobody expected
from him much real grief, and he does not seem to know
how to act it consistently; he spoke of his brother with all
the semblance of feeling, and in a tone of voice properly
softened and subdued, but just afterwards, when they gave
him the pen to sign the declaration, he said, in his usual tone,
&lsquo;This is a damned bad pen you have given me.&rsquo; My worthy
colleague Mr. James Buller began to swear Privy Councillors
in the name of &lsquo;King George IV.&mdash;William, I mean,&rsquo; to the
great diversion of the Council.</p>

<p>A few days after my return I was sworn in, all the Ministers
and some others being present. His Majesty presided
very decently, and looked like a respectable old admiral. The
Duke [of Wellington] told me he was delighted with him&mdash;&lsquo;If
I had been able to deal with my late master as I do with
my present, I should have got on much better&rsquo;&mdash;that he
was so reasonable and tractable, and that he had done more
business with him in ten minutes than with the other in as
many days.</p>

<p>I met George Fitzclarence, afterwards Earl of
Munster,<a name="FNA_11_01" id="FNA_11_01"></a><a href="#FN_11_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
the same day, and repeated what the Duke said, and he told
me how delighted his father was with the Duke, his entire
confidence in him, and that the Duke might as entirely
depend upon the King; that he had told his Majesty, when
he was at Paris, that Polignac and the Duke of Orleans had
both asked him whether the Duke of Clarence, when he
became King, would keep the Duke of Wellington as his
Minister, and the King said, &lsquo;What did you reply?&rsquo; &lsquo;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
replied that you certainly would; did not I do right?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Certainly, you did quite right.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_01" id="FN_11_01"></a><a href="#FNA_11_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[Eldest son of King William IV. by Mrs. Jordan, who was shortly
after the accession created an earl by his father. The rank of &lsquo;marquis&rsquo;s
younger children&rsquo; was conferred upon the rest of the family. The King
had nine natural children by Mrs. Jordan: 1, George, a major-general in
the army, afterwards Earl of Munster; 2, Frederick, also in the army; 3,
Adolphus, a rear-admiral; 4, Augustus, in holy orders; 5. Sophia, married
to Lord de l&rsquo;Isle; 6, Mary, married to Colonel Fox; 7, Elizabeth, married
to the Earl of Errol; 8, Augusta, married first to the Hon. John Kennedy
Erskine, and secondly to Lord John Frederick Gordon; 9, Amelia, married
to Viscount Falkland.]</p></div>

<p>He began immediately to do good-natured things, to
provide for old friends and professional adherents, and he
bestowed a pension upon Tierney&rsquo;s widow. The great offices
of Chamberlain and Steward he abandoned to the Duke of
Wellington. There never was anything like the enthusiasm
with which he was greeted by all ranks; though he has
trotted about both town and country for sixty-four years,
and nobody ever turned round to look at him, he cannot stir
now without a mob, patrician as well as plebeian, at his heels.
All the Park congregated round the gate to see him drive
into town the day before yesterday. But in the midst of all
this success and good conduct certain indications of strangeness
and oddness peep out which are not a little alarming,
and he promises to realise the fears of his Ministers that he
will do and say too much, though they flatter themselves
that they have muzzled him in his approaching progress by
reminding him that his words will be taken as his Ministers&rsquo;,
and he must, therefore, be chary of them.</p>

<p>At the late King&rsquo;s funeral he behaved with great indecency.
That ceremony was very well managed, and a fine
sight, the military part particularly, and the Guards were
magnificent. The attendance was not very numerous, and
when they had all got together in St. George&rsquo;s Hall a gayer
company I never beheld; with the exception of Mount Charles,
who was deeply affected, they were all as merry as grigs.
The King was chief mourner, and, to my astonishment, as he
entered the chapel directly behind the body, in a situation
in which he should have been apparently, if not really,
absorbed in the melancholy duty he was performing, he
darted up to Strathaven, who was ranged on one side below
the Dean&rsquo;s stall, shook him heartily by the hand, and then
went on nodding to the right and left. He had previously
gone as chief mourner to sit for an hour at the head of the
body as it lay in state, and he walked in procession with his
household to the apartment. I saw him pass from behind
the screen. Lord Jersey had been in the morning to Bushy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISLIKE OF THE DUKE OF CUMBERLAND.</span>
to kiss hands on being made Chamberlain, when he had
received him very graciously, told him it was the Duke and
not himself who had made him, but that he was delighted
to have him. At Windsor, when he arrived, he gave
Jersey the white wand, or rather took one from him he had
provided for himself, and gave it him again with a little
speech. When he went to sit in state, Jersey preceded him,
and he said when all was ready, &lsquo;Go on to the body, Jersey;
you will get your dress coat as soon as you can.&rsquo; The
morning after the funeral, having slept at Frogmore, he
went all over the Castle, into every room in the house, which
he had never seen before except when he came there as a
guest; after which he received an address from the ecclesiastical
bodies of Windsor and Eton, and returned an answer
quite unpremeditated which they told me was excellent.</p>

<p>He is very well with all his family, particularly the Duke
of Sussex, but he dislikes and seems to know the Duke of
Cumberland, who is furious at his own discredit. The King
has taken from him the Gold Stick, by means of which he
had usurped the functions of all the other colonels of the
regiments of the Guards, and put himself always about the
late King. He says the Duke&rsquo;s rank is too high to perform
those functions, and has put an end to his services. He has
only put the Gold Sticks on their former footing, and they are
all to take the duty in turn.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Duke of Cumberland has shown his
teeth in another way. His horses have hitherto stood in the
stables which are appropriated to the Queen, and the other day
Lord Errol, her new Master of the Horse, went to her Majesty
and asked her where she chose her horses should be; she
said, of course, she knew nothing about it, but in the proper
place. Errol then said the Duke of Cumberland&rsquo;s horses
were in her stables, and could not be got out without an
order from the King. The King was spoken to, and he
commanded the Duke of Leeds to order them out. The
Duke of Leeds took the order to the Duke of Cumberland,
who said &lsquo;he would be damned if they should go,&rsquo; when the
Duke of Leeds said that he trusted he would have them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
taken out the following day, as unless he did so he should
be under the necessity of ordering them to be removed by
the King&rsquo;s grooms, when the Duke was obliged sulkily to
give way. When the King gave the order to the Duke of
Leeds, he sent for Taylor that he might be present, and said
at the same time that he had a very bad opinion of the Duke
of Cumberland, and he wished he would live out of the
country.</p>

<p>The King&rsquo;s good-nature, simplicity, and affability to all
about him are certainly very striking, and in his elevation
he does not forget any of his old friends and companions.
He was in no hurry to take upon himself the dignity of King,
nor to throw off the habits and manners of a country gentleman.
When Lord Chesterfield went to Bushy to kiss his hand,
and be presented to the Queen, he found Sir John and Lady
Gore there lunching, and when they went away the King called
for their carriage, handed Lady Gore into it, and stood at
the door to see them off. When Lord Howe came over from
Twickenham to see him, he said the Queen was going out
driving, and should &lsquo;drop him&rsquo; at his own house. The
Queen, they say, is by no means delighted at her elevation.
She likes quiet and retirement and Bushy (of which the King
has made her Ranger), and does not want to be a Queen.
However, &lsquo;L&rsquo;appétit viendra en mangeant.&rsquo; He says he does
not want luxury and magnificence, has slept in a cot, and he
has dismissed the King&rsquo;s cooks, &lsquo;renversé la marmite.&rsquo; He
keeps the stud (which is to be diminished) because he thinks
he ought to support the turf. He has made Mount Charles
a Lord of the Bedchamber, and given the Robes to Sir C.
Pole, an admiral. Altogether he seems a kind-hearted, well-meaning,
not stupid, burlesque, bustling old fellow, and if
he doesn&rsquo;t go mad may make a very decent King, but he
exhibits oddities. He would not have his servants in mourning&mdash;that
is, not those of his own family and household&mdash;but
he sent the Duke of Sussex to Mrs. Fitzherbert to desire
she would put hers in mourning, and consequently so they
are. The King and she have always been friends, as she
has, in fact, been with all the Royal Family, but it was very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING&rsquo;S ODDITIES.</span>
strange. Yesterday morning he sent for the officer on
guard, and ordered him to take all the muffles off the drums,
the scarfs off the regimentals, and so to appear on parade,
where he went himself. The colonel would have put the
officer under arrest for doing this without his orders, but the
King said he was commanding officer of his own guard,
and forbade him. All odd, and people are frightened, but
his wits will at least last till the new Parliament meets.
I sent him a very respectful request through Taylor that he
would pay 300&#8467;., all that remained due of the Duke of York&rsquo;s
debts at Newmarket, which he assented to directly, as soon
as the Privy Purse should be settled&mdash;very good-natured. In
the meantime it is said that the bastards are dissatisfied
that more is not done for them, but he cannot do much for
them at once, and he must have time. He has done all he
can; he has made Errol Master of the Horse, Sidney a
Guelph and Equerry, George Fitzclarence the same and Adjutant-General,
and doubtless they will all have their turn. Of
course the stories told about the rapacity of the Conynghams
have been innumerable. The King&rsquo;s will excited much
astonishment, but as yet nothing is for certain known about
the money, or what became of it, or what he gave away, and
to whom, in his lifetime.</p>

<h3>July 20th, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday was a very busy day with his
Majesty, who is going much too fast, and begins to alarm
his Ministers and astonish the world. In the morning he
inspected the Coldstream Guards, dressed (for the first time
in his life) in a military uniform and with a great pair of
gold spurs half-way up his legs like a game cock, although
he was not to ride, for having chalk-stones in his hands he
can&rsquo;t hold the reins. The Queen came to Lady Bathurst&rsquo;s to
see the review and hold a sort of drawing-room, when the
Ministers&rsquo; wives were presented to her, and official men, to
which were added Lady Bathurst&rsquo;s relations; everybody was
in undress except the officers. She is very ugly, with a
horrid complexion, but has good manners, and did all this
(which she hated) very well. She said the part as if she
was acting, and wished the green curtain to drop. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
the review the King, with the Dukes of Cumberland, Sussex,
and Gloucester, and Prince George and the Prince of Prussia,
and the Duchess of Cumberland&rsquo;s son, came in through the
garden gate; the Duchess of Gloucester and Princess Augusta
were already there; they breakfasted and then went away, the
Duke of Gloucester bowing to the company while nobody was
taking any notice of him or thinking about him. Nature must
have been merry when she made this Prince, and in the sort
of mood that certain great artists used to exhibit in their
comical caricatures; I never saw a countenance which that
line in Dryden&rsquo;s M&lsquo;Flecknoe would so well describe&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And lambent dulness plays around his face.</span>
</div></div>

<p>At one there was to be a Council, to swear in Privy
Councillors and Lords-Lieutenant, and receive Oxford and
Cambridge addresses. The review made it an hour later,
and the Lieutenants, who had been summoned at one, and who
are great, selfish, pampered aristocrats, were furious at being
kept waiting, particularly Lord Grosvenor and the Duke
of Newcastle, the former very peevish, the latter bitter-humoured.
I was glad to see them put to inconvenience.
I never saw so full a Court, so much nobility with academical
tagrag and bobtail. After considerable delay the
King received the Oxford and Cambridge addresses on the
throne, which (having only one throne between them) he
then abdicated for the Queen to seat herself on and receive
them too. She sat it very well, surrounded by the Princesses
and her ladies and household. When this mob could be got
rid of the table was brought in and the Council held. The
Duke was twice sworn as Constable of the Tower and Lieutenant
of Hants; then Jersey and the new Privy Councillors;
and then the host of Lieutenants six or seven at a time,
or as many as could hold a bit of the Testament. I begged
the King would, to expedite the business, dispense with their
kneeling, which he did, and so we got on rapidly enough;
and I whispered to Jersey, who stood by me behind the King
with his white wand, &lsquo;The farce is good, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; as they
each kissed his hand. I told him their name or county, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING IN ST. JAMES&rsquo;S STREET.</span>
both, and he had a civil word to say to everybody, inviting
some to dinner, promising to visit others, reminding them of
former visits, or something good-humoured; he asked Lord
Egremont&rsquo;s <i>permission</i> to go and live in his county, at
Brighton.</p>

<p>All this was very well; no great harm in it; more
affable, less dignified than the late King; but when this
was over, and he might very well have sat himself quietly
down and rested, he must needs put on his plainer clothes
and start on a ramble about the streets, alone too. In
Pall Mall he met Watson Taylor, and took his arm and
went up St. James&rsquo;s Street. There he was soon followed
by a mob making an uproar, and when he got near White&rsquo;s
a woman came up and kissed him. Belfast (who had
been sworn in Privy Councillor in the morning), who saw
this from White&rsquo;s, and Clinton thought it time to interfere,
and came out to attend upon him. The mob increased, and,
always holding W. Taylor&rsquo;s arm, and flanked by Clinton
and Belfast, who got shoved and kicked about to their inexpressible
wrath, he got back to the Palace amid shouting
and bawling and applause. When he got home he asked
them to go in and take a quiet walk in the garden, and said,
&lsquo;Oh, never mind all this; when I have walked about a few
times they will get used to it, and will take no notice.&rsquo;
There are other stories, but I will put down nothing I do not
see or hear, or hear from the witnesses. Belfast told me this
in the Park, fresh from the scene and smarting from the
buffeting he had got. All the Park was ringing with it, and
I told Lady Bathurst, who thought it so serious she said she
would get Lord Bathurst to write to the Duke directly about
it. Lord Combermere wanted to be made a Privy Councillor
yesterday, but the Duke would not let it be done; he
is in a sort of half-disgrace, and is not to be made yet, but
will be by-and-by.</p>

<h3>Grove Road, July 21st, 1830</h3>

<p>I came and established myself
here last night after the Duchess of Bedford&rsquo;s ball. Lady
Bathurst told me that the Queen spoke to her yesterday
morning about the King&rsquo;s walk and being followed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
said that for the future he must walk early in the morning,
or in some less public place, so there are hopes that his
activity may be tamed. He sent George Fitzclarence off
from dinner in his silk stockings and cocked hat to Boulogne
to invite the King of Würtemberg to come here; he was
back in fifty-six hours, and might have been in less. He
employs him in everything, and I heard Fitzclarence yesterday
ask the Duke of Leeds for two of his father&rsquo;s horses to
ride about on his jobs and relieve his own, which the Duke
agreed to, but made a wry face. Mount Charles has refused
to be Lord of the Bedchamber; his wife can&rsquo;t bear it, and he
doesn&rsquo;t like to go to Windsor under such altered circumstances.
I hardly ever record the scandalous stories of the
day, unless they relate to characters or events, but what relates
to public men is different from the loves and friendships
of the idiots of society.</p>

<h3>July 24th, 1830</h3>

<p>Went to St. James&rsquo;s the day before yesterday
for a Council for the dissolution, but there was none. Yesterday
morning there was an idea of having one, but it is
to-day instead, and early in the morning, that the Ministers
may be able to go to their fish dinner at Greenwich. I
called on the Duke yesterday evening to know about a Council,
but he could not tell me. Then came a Mr. Moss (or his
card) while I was there. &lsquo;Who is he?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Oh, a man
who wants to see me about a canal. I can&rsquo;t see him. Everybody
will see me, and how the Devil they think I am to see
everybody, and be the whole morning with the King, and to
do the whole business of the country, I don&rsquo;t know. I am
quite worn out with it.&rsquo; I longed to tell him that it is this
latter part they would willingly relieve him from.</p>

<p>I met Vesey Fitzgerald, just come from Paris, and had
a long conversation with him about the state of the Government;
he seems aware of the difficulties and the necessity
of acquiring more strength, of the universal persuasion that
the Duke will be all in all, and says that in the Cabinet
nobody can be more reasonable and yielding and deferential
to the opinions of his colleagues. But Murray&rsquo;s appointment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING GOES DOWN TO PARLIAMENT.</span>
he says, was a
mistake,<a name="FNA_11_02" id="FNA_11_02"></a><a href="#FN_11_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and no personal consideration
should induce the Duke to sacrifice the interests of the
country by keeping him; it may be disagreeable to dismiss
him, but he must do it. Hay told me that for the many
years he had been in office he had never met with any public
officer so totally inefficient as he, not even Warrender at the
Admiralty Board.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_02" id="FN_11_02"></a><a href="#FNA_11_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[Sir George Murray was Secretary of State for the Colonial Department.]</p></div>

<p>In the meantime the King has had his levee, which was
crowded beyond all precedent. He was very civil to the
people, particularly to Sefton, who had quarrelled with the
late King.</p>

<p>Yesterday he went to the House of Lords, and was
admirably received. I can fancy nothing like his delight at
finding himself in the state coach surrounded by all his
pomp. He delivered the Speech very well, they say, for I
did not go to hear him. He did not wear the crown,
which was carried by Lord Hastings. Etiquette is a thing
he cannot comprehend. He wanted to take the King of
Würtemberg with him in his coach, till he was told it was
out of the question. In his private carriage he continues
to sit backwards, and when he goes with men makes one
sit by him and not opposite to him. Yesterday, after the
House of Lords, he drove all over the town in an open
calèche with the Queen, Princess Augusta, and the King of
Würtemberg, and coming home he set down the King
(<i>dropped him</i>, as he calls it) at Grillon&rsquo;s Hotel. The King of
England dropping another king at a tavern! It is impossible
not to be struck with his extreme good-nature and
simplicity, which he cannot or will not exchange for the
dignity of his new situation and the trammels of etiquette;
but he ought to be made to understand that his simplicity
degenerates into vulgarity, and that without departing from
his natural urbanity he may conduct himself so as not to
lower the character with which he is invested, and which
belongs not to him, but to the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
At his dinner at St. James&rsquo;s the other day more people
were invited than there was room for, and some half-dozen
were forced to sit at a side table. He said to Lord Brownlow,
&lsquo;Well, when you are flooded (he thinks Lincolnshire is
all fen) you will come to us at Windsor.&rsquo; To the Freemasons
he was rather good. The Duke of Sussex wanted
him to receive their address in a solemn audience, which he
refused, and when they did come he said, &lsquo;Gentlemen, if my
love for you equalled my ignorance of everything concerning
you, it would be unbounded,&rsquo; and then he added something
good-humoured. The consequence of his trotting about, and
saying the odd things he does, is that there are all sorts of
stories about him which are not true, and he is always expected
everywhere. In the meantime I believe that politically
he relies implicitly on the Duke, who can make him
do anything. Agar Ellis (who is bustling and active, always
wishing to play a part, and gets mixed up with the politics
of this and that party through his various connections)
told me the other day that he knew the Duke was knocking
at every door, hitherto without success, and that he must
be contented to take a <i>party</i>, and not expect to strengthen
himself by picking out individuals. I think this too, but
why not open his doors to all comers? There are no questions
now to stand in his way; his Government must be remodelled,
and he may last for ever personally.</p>

<h3>July 25th, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday at Court at eleven; a Council for
the dissolution. This King and these Councils are very unlike
the last&mdash;few people present, frequent, punctual, less
ceremony observed. Though these Ministers have been in
office all their lives, nobody knew how many days must elapse
before Parliament was summoned; some said sixty, some
seventy days, but not one knew, nor had they settled the
matter previously; so Lord Rosslyn and I were obliged to
go to Bridgewater House, which was near, and consult the
journals. It has always been fifty-two days of late.</p>

<p>In the afternoon another embarrassment. We sent the
proclamations to the Chancellor (one for England and one
for Ireland), to have the Great Seal affixed to them; he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING DINES AT APSLEY HOUSE.</span>
would only affix the Seal to the English, and sent back the
Irish unsealed. The Secretary of State would not send it to
Ireland without the Great Seal, and all the Ministers were
gone to the fish dinner at Greenwich, so that there was no
getting at anybody. At last we got it done at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn
and sent it off. The fact is, nobody knows his business, and
the Chancellor least of all. The King continues very active;
he went after the Council to Buckingham House, then to the
Thames Tunnel, has immense dinners every day, and the
same people two or three days running. He has dismissed
the late King&rsquo;s band, and employs the bands of the Guards
every night, who are ready to die of it, for they get no pay
and are prevented earning money elsewhere. The other
night the King had a party, and at eleven o&rsquo;clock he dismissed
them thus: &lsquo;Now, ladies and gentlemen, I wish you a
good night. I will not detain you any longer from your
amusements, and shall go to my own, which is to go to bed;
so come along, my Queen.&rsquo; The other day he was very
angry because the guard did not know him in his plain
clothes and turn out for him&mdash;the first appearance of jealousy
of his greatness he has shown&mdash;and he ordered them to be
more on the alert for the future.</p>

<h3>July 26th, 1830</h3>

<p>Still the King; his adventures (for they are
nothing else) furnish matter of continual amusement and
astonishment to his liege subjects. Yesterday morning, or
the evening before, he announced to the Duke of Wellington
that he should dine with him yesterday; accordingly the
Duke was obliged, in the midst of preparations for his
breakfast, to get a dinner ready for him. In the morning
he took the King of Würtemberg to Windsor, and just at the
hour when the Duke expected him to dinner he was driving
through Hyde Park back from Windsor&mdash;three barouches-and-four,
the horses dead knocked up, in the front the two
Kings, Jersey, and somebody else, all covered with dust. The
whole mob of carriages and horsemen assembled near Apsley
House to see him pass and to wait till he returned. The
Duke, on hearing he was there, rushed down without his hat
and stood in his gate in the middle of servants, mob, &amp;c., to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
see him pass. He drove to Grillon&rsquo;s &lsquo;to drop&rsquo; the King of
Würtemberg, and at a quarter past eight he arrived at
Apsley House. There were about forty-five men, no women,
half the Ministers, most of the foreign Ministers, and a
mixture rather indiscriminate. In the evening I was at
Lady Salisbury&rsquo;s, when arrived the Duke of Sussex, who
gave a short account to Sefton of what had passed, and of
the King&rsquo;s speech to the company. &lsquo;You and I,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;are
old Whigs, my Lord, and I confess I was somewhat astonished
to hear his Majesty&rsquo;s speech.&rsquo; I went afterwards
to Crockford&rsquo;s, where I found Matuscewitz, who gave me a
whole account of the dinner. The two Kings went out to
dinner arm in arm, the Duke followed; the King sat between
the King of Würtemberg and the Duke. After dinner his
health was drunk, to which he returned thanks, sitting, but
briefly, and promised to say more by-and-by when he should
give a toast. In process of time he desired Douro to go and
tell the band to play the merriest waltz they could for the
toast he was about to give. He then gave &lsquo;The Queen of
Würtemberg,&rsquo; with many eulogiums on her and on the
connubial felicity of her and the King; not a very agreeable
theme for his host, for conjugal fidelity is not his forte. At
length he desired Douro to go again to the band and order
them to play &lsquo;See the conquering hero comes,&rsquo; and then he
rose. All the company rose with him, when he ordered
everybody to sit down. Still standing, he said that he had
been so short a time on the throne that he did not know
whether etiquette required that he should speak sitting or
standing, but, however this might be, he had been long
used to speak on his legs, and should do so now; he then
proposed the Duke&rsquo;s health, but prefaced it with a long
speech&mdash;instituted a comparison between him and the Duke
of Marlborough; went back to the reign of Queen Anne, and
talked of the great support the Duke of Marlborough had
received from the Crown, and the little support the Duke of
Wellington had had in the outset of his career, though after
the battle of Vimeiro he had been backed by all the energies
of the country; that, notwithstanding his difficulties, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING&rsquo;S SPEECH AT APSLEY HOUSE.</span>
career had been one continued course of victory over the
armies of France; and then recollecting the presence of
Laval, the French Ambassador, he said, &lsquo;Remember, Duc de
Laval, when I talk of victories over the French armies, they
were not the armies of my ally and friend the King of
France, but of him who had usurped his throne, and
against whom you yourself were combating;&rsquo; then going
back to the Duke&rsquo;s career, and again referring to the comparison
between him and Marlborough, and finishing by
adverting to his political position, that he had on mounting
the throne found the Duke Minister, and that he had retained
him because he thought his Administration had been
and would be highly beneficial to the country; that he gave
to him his fullest and most cordial confidence, and that he
announced to all whom he saw around him, to all the Ambassadors
and Ministers of foreign Powers, and to all the
noblemen and gentlemen present, that as long as he should
sit upon the throne he should continue to give him the same
confidence. The Duke returned thanks in a short speech,
thanking the King for his confidence and support, and declaring
that all his endeavours would be used to keep this
country in relations of harmony with other nations. The
whole company stood aghast at the King&rsquo;s extraordinary
speech and declaration. Matuscewitz told me he never was
so astonished, that for the world he would not have missed
it, and that he would never have believed in it if he had
not heard it.</p>

<p>Falck<a name="FNA_11_03" id="FNA_11_03"></a><a href="#FN_11_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
gave me a delightful account of the speech and
of Laval. He thought, not understanding one word, that
all the King was saying was complimentary to the King of
France and the French nation, and he kept darting from his
seat to make his acknowledgments, while Esterhazy held
him down by the tail of his coat, and the King stopped him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
with his hand outstretched, all with great difficulty. He
said it was very comical.</p>

<h3>July 27th, 1830</h3>

<p>Review in the morning (yesterday), breakfast
at Apsley House, chapter of the Garter, dinner at St.
James&rsquo;s, party in the evening, and ball at Apsley House. I
don&rsquo;t hear of anything remarkable, and it was so hot I could
not go to anything, except the breakfast, which I just looked
in to for a minute, and found everybody sweating and stuffing
and the royalties just going away. The Duke of Gloucester
keeps up his quarrel with the Duke; the Duke of Cumberland
won&rsquo;t go to Apsley House, but sent the Duchess and
his boy. The Queen said at dinner the other day to the
Duke of Cumberland, &lsquo;I am very much pleased with you for
sending the Duchess to Apsley House,&rsquo; and then turned to
the Duke of Gloucester and said, &lsquo;but I am not pleased with
you for not letting the Duchess go there.&rsquo; The fool answered
that the Duchess should never go there; he would not be
reconciled, forgetting that it matters not twopence to the
Duke of Wellington and a great deal to himself.</p>

<p>I have been employed in settling half a dozen disputes of
different sorts, but generally without success, trifling matters,
foolish or violent people, not worth remembering any of
them. The Chancellor, who does not know his own business,
has made an attack on my office about the proclamations,
but I have vindicated it in a letter to Lord Bathurst.</p>

<h3>July 28th, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday Charles Wynn and I settled the
dispute between Clive and Charlton about the Ludlow
matters. Charlton agrees to retire from the contest both in
the Borough and Corporation, and Clive agrees to pay him.
1,125&#8467;. towards his expenses, and not to oppose the reception
of any petition that may be presented to the House of Commons
for the purpose of re-opening the question of the right
of voting. Both parties are very well satisfied with this
termination of their disputes. Met the Chancellor at Lady
Ravensworth&rsquo;s breakfast yesterday, who told me he had sent
a rejoinder to my letter to Lord Bathurst about the proclamations.</p>

<h3>July 29th, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday a standing Council at the levee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ORDINANCES OF CHARLES X.</span>
to swear in Lord Hereford and Vesey Fitzgerald, and to
declare Lord Bathurst President of the Council and the
Duke of Northumberland Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Previously
the King received the address of the dissenting
ministers, and then that of the Quakers, presented by
William Allen; they were very prim and respectable persons;
their hats were taken off by each other in the room before
the Throne Room, and they did not bow, though they seemed
half inclined to do so; they made a very loyal address, but
without &lsquo;Majesty,&rsquo; and said &lsquo;O King.&rsquo; There was a question
after his answer what they should do. I thought it was
whether they should kiss hands, for the King said something
to Peel, who went and asked them, and I heard the King
say, &lsquo;Oh, just as they like; they needn&rsquo;t if they don&rsquo;t like;
it&rsquo;s all one.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the great event of the day was the reception of the
King of France&rsquo;s two decrees, and the address of his
Ministers, who produced them; nothing could surpass the
universal astonishment and consternation. Falck told me
he was reading the newspaper at his breakfast regularly
through, and when he came to this the teacup almost
dropped from his hands, and he rubbed his eyes to see
whether he read correctly. Such was the secresy with which
this measure was conceived and acted on, that Pozzo, who is
quicker and has better intelligence than anybody, had not a
notion of it, as Matuscewitz told me. Aberdeen learnt it
through the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and had not a line from Stuart. That,
however, is nothing extraordinary. I suspect somebody had
it, for Raikes wrote me a note the day before, to ask me if
there was not <i>something bad</i> from France. Matuscewitz told
me that Russia would not afford Charles X. the smallest
support in his new crusade against the Constitution of
France, and this he pronounced openly <i>à qui voulait l&rsquo;entendre</i>.
I suspect the Duke will be desperately annoyed.
The only Minister I had a word with about it was Lord
Bathurst, whose Tory blood bubbled a little quicker at such
a despotic act, and while owning the folly of the deed he
could not help adding that &lsquo;he should have repressed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
press when he dissolved the Chambers, then he might have
done it.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>July 30th, 1830</h3>

<p>Everybody anxious for news from France.
A few hope, and still fewer think, the King of France will
succeed, and that the French will submit, but the press
here joins in grand chorus against the suppression of the
liberty of that over the water. Matuscewitz told me he had
a conference with the Duke, who was excessively annoyed,
but what seems to have struck him more than anything is
the extraordinary secresy of the business, and neither Pozzo
nor Stuart having known one word of it. Up to the last
Polignac has deceived everybody, and put such words into
the King&rsquo;s mouth that nobody could expect such a <i>coup</i>.
The King assured Pozzo di Borgo the day before that
nothing of the sort was in contemplation. This, like everything
else, will be judged by the event&mdash;desperate fatuity if
it fails, splendid energy and accurate calculation of opposite
moral forces if it succeeds. I judge that it will fail,
because I can see no marks of wisdom in the style of execution,
and the State paper is singularly puerile and weak in
argument. It is passionate and not dexterous, not even
plausible. All this is wonderfully interesting, and will give
us a lively autumn.</p>

<p>The King has been to Woolwich, inspecting the artillery,
to whom he gave a dinner, with toasts and hip, hip, hurrahing
and three times three, himself giving the time. I tremble
for him; at present he is only a mountebank, but he bids fair
to be a maniac.</p>

<p>Brougham will come in for Yorkshire without a contest;
his address was very eloquent. He is rather mad without a
doubt; his speeches this year have been sometimes more
brilliant than ever they were; but who with such stupendous
talents was ever so little considered? We admire him as
we do a fine actor, and nobody ever possessed such enormous
means, and displayed a mind so versatile, fertile, and comprehensive,
and yet had so little efficacy and influence.
He told me just before he left town that Yorkshire had been
proposed to him, but that he had written word he would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">REVOLUTION IN PARIS.</span>
stand, nor spend a guinea, nor go there, nor even take the
least trouble about the concerns of anyone of his constituents,
if they elected him; but he soon changed his note.</p>

<h3>July 31st, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning I met Matuscewitz in St.
James&rsquo;s Street, who said, &lsquo;You have heard the news?&rsquo; But
I had not, so I got into his cabriolet, and he told me that
Bülow had just been with him with an account of Rothschild&rsquo;s
estafette, who had brought intelligence of a desperate
conflict at Paris between the people and the Royal Guard, in
which 1,000 men had been killed of the former, and of the
eventual revolt of two regiments, which decided the business;
that the Swiss had refused to fire on the people; the King is
gone to Rambouillet, the Ministers are missing, and the Deputies
who were at Paris had assembled in the Chambers, and
declared their sittings permanent. Nothing can exceed the
interest and excitement that all these proceedings create here,
and unless there is a reaction, which does not seem probable,
the game is up with the Bourbons. They richly deserve
their fate. It remains to be seen what part Bourmont and
the Algerian army will take; the latter will probably side with
the nation, and the former will be guided by his own interest,
and is not unlikely to endeavour to direct a spirit which he
could not expect to control. He may reconcile himself to the
country by a double treachery.</p>

<p><i>At night.</i>&mdash;To-day at one o&rsquo;clock Stuart&rsquo;s messenger
arrived with a meagre account, having left Paris on the
night of the 29th. The tricoloured flag had been raised; the
National Guard was up, commanded by old Lafayette (their
chief forty years ago), who ruled in Paris with Gérard,
Odier, Casimir Périer, Lafitte, and one or two more. The
Tuileries and the Louvre had been pillaged; the King was at
Rambouillet, where Marshal Marmont had retired, and had
with him a large force. Nobody, however, believed they would
fight against the people. The Deputies and the Peers had met,
and the latter separated without doing anything; the former
had a stormy discussion, but came to no resolution. Some
were for a republic, some for the Duke of Orleans, some for
the Duke of Bordeaux with the Duke of Orleans as Regent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Rothschild had another courier with later intelligence. The
King had desired to treat, and that proposals might be made
to him; all the Ministers escaped from Paris by a subterranean
passage which led from the Tuileries to the river,
and even at St. Cloud the Duke told Matuscewitz that &lsquo;Marmont
had taken up a good military position,&rsquo; as if it was a
military and not a moral question. Strange he should think
of such a thing, but they are all terrified to death at the
national flag and colours, because they see in its train
revolutions, invasions, and a thousand alarms. I own I
would rather have seen an easy transfer of the Crown to
some other head under the white flag. There was Lady
Tankerville going about to-day enquiring of everybody for
news, trembling for her brother &lsquo;and his brigade.&rsquo; Late in
the day she got Lady Jersey to go with her to Rothschild,
whom she saw, and Madame Rothschild, who showed her all
their letters. Tankerville, who is a sour, malignant little Whig
(since become an ultra-Tory), loudly declares Polignac ought
to be hung. The elections here are going against Government,
and no candidate will avow that he stands on Government
interest, or with the intention of supporting the Duke&rsquo;s
Ministry, which looks as if it had lost all its popularity.</p>

<h3>August 2nd, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday (Sunday) we had no news and no
reports, except one that Marmont was killed. I never believe
reports. The elections still go against Government. G.
Dawson returned from Dublin; all the Peels lose their seats.
Fordwich beat Baring at Canterbury by 370 votes. It is
said the King was in a state of great excitement at Woolwich
the other day, when it was very hot, and he drank a
good deal of wine.</p>

<p><i>Evening</i>.&mdash;This morning, on going into town, I read in
the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; the news of the day&mdash;the proclamation of the
Provisional Government, the invitation to the Duke of
Orleans, his proclamation, and the account of the conversation
between Lafitte and Marmont. It is in vain to look
for private or official information, for the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; always
has the latest and the best; Stuart sends next to nothing.
Soon after I got to George Street the Duke of Wellington
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WELLINGTON ON THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.</span>
came in, in excellent spirits, and talked over the whole
matter. He said he could not comprehend how the Royal
Guard had been defeated by the mob, and particularly how
they had been forced to evacuate the Tuileries; that he had
seen English and French troops hold houses whole days not
one-fourth so strong. I said that there could not be a
shadow of doubt that it was because they <i>would</i> not fight,
that if they <i>would</i> have fought they must have beat the
mob, and reminded him of the French at Madrid, and asked
him if he did not think his regiment would beat all the
populace of London, which he said it would. He described
the whole affair as it has taken place, and said that there
can be no doubt that the moneyed men of Paris (who are all
against the Government) and the Liberals had foreseen a
violent measure on the part of the King, and had organised
the resistance; that on the appearance of the edicts the
bankers simultaneously refused to discount any bills, on
which the great manufacturers and merchants dismissed
their workmen, to the number of many thousands, who inflamed
the public discontent, and united to oppose the
military and the execution of the decrees. He said positively
that we should not take any part, and that no other
Government ought or could. He does not like the Duke of
Orleans, and thinks his proclamation mean and shabby, but
owned that under all circumstances his election to the Crown
would probably be the best thing that could happen. The
Duke of Chartres he had known here, and thought he was
intelligent. The Duke considered the thing as settled, but
did not feel at all sure they would offer the Crown to the
Duke of Orleans. He said he could not guess or form an
opinion as to their ulterior proceedings.</p>

<p>After discussing the whole business with his usual
simplicity, he began talking of the Duke of Cumberland and
his resignation of the command of the Blues. Formerly the
colonels of the two regiments of Life Guards held alternately
the Gold Stick, and these two regiments were under
the immediate orders of the King, and not of the Commander-in-Chief.
When the Duke of Wellington returned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
from Spain and had the command of the Blues, the King
insisted upon his taking the duty also; so it was divided
into three, but the Blues still continued under the Commander-in-Chief.
But when the Duke of Cumberland
wanted to be continually about the King, he got him to give
him the command of the Household troops; this was at the
period of the death of the Duke of York and the Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s becoming Commander-in-Chief. The Duke of
Cumberland told the Duke of Wellington that he had received
the King&rsquo;s verbal commands to that effect, and from
that time he alone kept the Gold Stick, and the Blues were
withdrawn from the authority of the Commander-in-Chief.
The Duke of Wellington made no opposition; but last year,
during the uproar on the Catholic question, he perceived the
inconvenience of the arrangement, and intended to speak
to the King about it, for the Duke of Cumberland was
concerned in organising mobs to go down to Windsor
to frighten Lady Conyngham and the King, and the Horse
Guards, who would naturally have been called out to suppress
any tumult, would not have been disposable without the
Duke of Cumberland&rsquo;s concurrence, so much so that on one
particular occasion, when the Kentish men were to have
gone to Windsor 20,000 strong, the Duke of Wellington
detained a regiment of light cavalry who were marching
elsewhere, that he might not be destitute of military aid.
Before, however, he did anything about this with the King
(&lsquo;I always,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;do one thing at a time&rsquo;) his Majesty
was taken ill and died.</p>

<p>On the accession of the present King the Duke of
Cumberland wished to continue the same system, which his
Majesty was resolved he should not, and he ordered that the
colonels of the regiments should take the Stick in rotation.
He also ordered (through Sir R. Peel) that Lord Combermere
should command the troops at the funeral as Gold Stick.
This the Duke of Cumberland resisted, and sent down orders
to Lord Cathcart to assume the command. The Duke of
Wellington, however, represented to Lord Cathcart that he
had better do no such thing, as nobody could disobey the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WARDROBE OF GEORGE IV.</span>
King&rsquo;s orders gone through the Secretary of State, and accordingly
he did nothing. But the King was determined to
put an end to the pretensions of the Duke of Cumberland,
and spoke to the Duke on the subject, and said that he
would have all the regiments placed under the orders of the
Commander-in-Chief. The Duke recommended him to replace
the matter in the state in which it stood before the
Duke of Cumberland&rsquo;s pretensions had altered it, but he
would not do this, and chose to abide by his original intention;
so the three regiments were placed under the orders of
the Horse Guards like the rest, and the Duke of Cumberland
in consequence resigned the command of the Blues.</p>

<h3>August 3rd, 1830</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the above story, the King
dined with the Duke of Cumberland at Kew yesterday. I
went yesterday to the sale of the late King&rsquo;s wardrobe,
which was numerous enough to fill Monmouth Street, and
sufficiently various and splendid for the wardrobe of Drury
Lane. He hardly ever gave away anything except his
linen, which was distributed every year. These clothes are
the perquisite of his pages, and will fetch a pretty sum.
There are all the coats he has ever had for fifty years,
300 whips, canes without number, every sort of uniform, the
costumes of all the orders in Europe, splendid furs, pelisses,
hunting-coats and breeches, and among other things a
dozen pair of corduroy breeches he had made to hunt in
when Don Miguel was here. His profusion in these articles
was unbounded, because he never paid for them, and his
memory was so accurate that one of his pages told me he
recollected every article of dress, no matter how old, and
that they were always liable to be called on to produce some
particular coat or other article of apparel of years gone by.
It is difficult to say whether in great or little things that
man was most odious and contemptible.</p>

<p>Nothing from France yesterday but the most absurd
reports.</p>

<h3>August 5th, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning at a Council; all the
Ministers, and the Duke of Rutland, Lords Somers, Rosslyn,
and Gower to be sworn Lieutenants. Talked about France
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with Sir G. Murray, who was silly enough to express his
disappointment that things promised to be soon and quietly
settled, and hoped the King would have assembled an army
and fought for it. Afterwards a levee. While the Queen
was in the closet they brought her word that Charles X.
was at Cherbourg, and had sent for leave to come here; but
nobody knew yesterday if this was true or not. In the
afternoon I met Vaudreuil, and had a long conversation with
him on the state of things. He said, &lsquo;My family has been
twice ruined by these cursed Bourbons, and I will be damned
if they shall a third time;&rsquo; that he had long foreseen the inevitable
tendency of Polignac&rsquo;s determination, ever since he
was here, when he had surrounded himself with low agents
and would admit no gentleman into his confidence; one of
his <i>affidés</i> was a man of the name of Carrier, a relation of the
famous Carrier de Nantes. Vaudreuil&rsquo;s father-in-law had
consulted him many months ago what to do with 300,000&#8467;.
which he had in the French funds, and he advised him to
sell it out and put it in his drawer, which he did, sacrificing
the interest for that time. He had hitherto done nothing,
been near none of the Ministers, feeling that he could say
nothing to them; no communication had been made to him,
but whenever any should be he intended to reply to it.
Laval ran away just in time, and Vaudreuil was so provoked
at his evasion that he sent after him to say that in such
important circumstances he could not take upon himself to
act without his Ambassador&rsquo;s instructions. No answer of
course. He thinks that if this had not taken place a few
years must have terminated the reign of the Bourbons, and
that it is only the difference between sudden and lingering
death; that when he was at Paris he had seen the dissatisfaction
of the young officers in the Guards, who were all
Liberal; and with these sentiments, what a condition they
must have been in when called upon to charge and fire on
the people while secretly approving of their conduct, &lsquo;entre
leurs devoirs de citoyens et de militaires!&rsquo;</p>

<p>I had a conversation with Fitzgerald (Vesey) the other
day about the Government and its prospects. They want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING GOES TO WINDSOR</span>
him greatly to return to office, but he is going abroad again
for his health, and I suspect is not very anxious to come in
just now, when things look gloomy. He thinks they have
acted very injudiciously in sending down candidates to
turn out their opponents, attempts which generally failed,
and only served to exasperate the people interested more
and more against them. Such men as the Grants, as he
said, cannot be kept out of Parliament. But they manage
everything ill, and it is impossible to look at the present
Ministry and watch its acts, and not marvel that the Duke
should think of going on with it. If he does not take
care he will be dragged down by it, whereas if he would,
while it is yet time, remodel it altogether, and open his
doors to all who are capable of serving under him (for all
are ready to take him as chief), he might secure to himself a
long and honourable possession of power. Then it is said
he can&rsquo;t whistle off these men merely because it is convenient,
but he had better do that than keep them on
bungling through all the business of the country. Besides, I
have some doubts of his tender-heartedness in this respect.</p>

<h3>Goodwood, August 10th, 1830</h3>

<p>On Saturday, the 7th, the King
and Queen breakfasted at Osterley, on their way to Windsor.
They had about sixty or seventy people to meet them, and it
all went off very well, without anything remarkable. I went
to Stoke afterwards, where there was the usual sort of party.</p>

<p>The King entered Windsor so privately that few people
knew him, though he made the horses walk all the way from
Frogmore that he might be seen. On Saturday and Sunday the
Terrace was thrown open, and the latter day it was crowded
by multitudes and a very gay sight; there were sentinels on
each side of the east front to prevent people walking under
the windows of the living-rooms, but they might go where
else they liked. The King went to Bagshot and did not
appear. All the late King&rsquo;s private drives through the Park
are also thrown open, but not to carriages. We went, however,
a long string of four carriages, to explore, and got
through the whole drive round by Virginia Water, the famous
fishing-pagoda, and saw all the penetralia of the late King,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
whose ghost must have been indignant at seeing us (Sefton
particularly) scampering all about his most secret recesses.
It is an exceedingly enjoyable spot, and pretty, but has not
so much beauty as I expected.</p>

<p>Came here yesterday and found thirty-two people assembled.
I rode over the downs three or four miles (from
Petworth), and never saw so delightful a country to live in.
There is an elasticity in the air and turf which communicates
itself to the spirits.</p>

<p>In the meantime the French Revolution has been proceeding
rapidly to its consummation, and the Duke of
Orleans is King. Montrond, who was at Stoke, thinks that
France will gravitate towards a republic, and principally for
this reason, that there is an unusual love of equality, and no
disposition to profit by the power of making <i>majorats</i>, therefore
that there never can be anything like an aristocracy.
We are so accustomed to see the regular working of our
constitutional system, with all its parts depending upon
each other, and so closely interwoven, that we have difficulty
in believing that any monarchical Government can exist
which is founded on a basis so different. This is the great
political problem which is now to be solved. I think, however,
that in the present settlement it is not difficult to see
the elements of future contention and the working of a
strong democratical spirit. The Crown has been conferred
on the Duke of Orleans by the Chamber of Deputies alone,
which, so far from inviting the Chamber of Peers to discuss
the question of succession, has at the same time decreed a
material alteration in that Chamber itself. It has at a blow
cut off all the Peers of Villèle&rsquo;s great promotion, which is an
enormous act of authority, although the measure may be
advisable. There is also a question raised of the hereditary
quality of the peerage, and I dare say that for the future
at least peerages will not be hereditary, not that I think this
signifies as to the existence of an aristocracy, for the constant
subdivision of property must deprive the Chamber of
all the qualities belonging to an English House of Lords,
and it would perhaps be better to establish another principle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FRENCH DEMOCRACY.</span>
such as that of promoting to the Chamber of Peers
men (for life) of great wealth, influence, and ability, who
would constitute an aristocracy of a different kind indeed,
but more respectable and efficient, than a host of poor
hereditary senators. What great men are Lord Lonsdale,
the Duke of Rutland, and Lord Cleveland! but strip them,
of their wealth and power, what would they be? Among
the most insignificant of mankind; but they all acquire a
factitious consideration by the influence they possess to do
good and evil, the extension of it over multitudes of dependents.
The French can have no aristocracy but a personal
one, ours is in the institution; theirs must be individually
respectable, as ours is collectively looked up to. In the
meantime it will be deemed a great step gained to have a
monarchy established in France at all, even for the moment,
but some people are alarmed at the excessive admiration
which the French Revolution has excited in England, and
there is a very general conviction that Spain will speedily
follow the example of France, and probably Belgium also.
Italy I don&rsquo;t believe will throw off the yoke; they have
neither spirit nor unanimity, and the Austrian military force
is too great to be resisted. But Austria will tremble and see
that the great victory which Liberalism has gained has
decided the question as to which principle, that of light or
darkness, shall prevail for the future in the world.</p>

<h3>London, August 14th, 1830</h3>

<p>Stayed at Goodwood till the 12th;
went to Brighton, riding over the downs from Goodwood to
Arundel, a delightful ride. How much I prefer England to
Italy! There we have mountains and sky; here, vegetation
and verdure, fine trees and soft turf; and in the long run
the latter are the most enjoyable. Yesterday came to
London from Brighton; found things much as they were, but
almost everybody gone out of town. The French are proceeding
steadily in the reconstruction of their Government,
but they have evinced a strong democratical spirit. The new
King, too, conducts himself in a way that gives me a bad
opinion of him; he is too complaisant to the rage for
equality, and stoops more than he need do; in fact, he overdoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
it. It is a piece of abominably bad taste (to say no
worse) to have conferred a pension on the author of the
Marseillaise hymn; for what can be worse than to rake up
the old ashes of Jacobinism, and what more necessary than
to distinguish as much as possible this Revolution from that
of 1789? Then he need not be more familiar as King than
he ever was as Duke of Orleans, and affect the manners of a
citizen and a plainness of dress and demeanour very suitable
to an American President, but unbecoming a descendant of
Louis XIV.</p>

<p>The new Charter is certainly drawn up with great moderation,
the few alterations which have been made approximating
it to the spirit of the English Constitution, and in
the whole of the proceedings the analogies of our revolution
have been pretty closely followed. But there has been a
remarkable deviation, which I think ominous, and I can&rsquo;t
imagine how it has escaped with so little animadversion
here. That is the cavalier manner in which the Chamber of
Peers has been treated, for the Deputies not only assumed
all the functions of Government and legislation, and disposed
by their authority of the Crown without inviting the concurrence
of the other Chamber, but at the same time they
exercised an enormous act of authority over the Chamber of
Peers itself in striking off the whole of that great promotion
of Charles X., which, however unwise and perhaps unconstitutional,
was perfectly legal, and those Peers had, in fact,
as good a right to their peerages as any of their colleagues.
They have reconstructed the Chamber of Peers, and conferred
upon it certain rights and privileges; but the power which
can create can also destroy, and it must be pretty obvious
after this that the Upper Chamber will be for the future
nothing better than a superior Court of Judicature, depending
for its existence upon the will of the popular branch. There
are some articles of the old Charter which I am astonished
at their keeping, but which they may possibly
alter<a name="FNA_11_04" id="FNA_11_04"></a><a href="#FN_11_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
at the
revision which is to take place next year, those particularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>

which limit the entrance to the Chamber of Deputies to men
of forty, and which give the initiation of laws to the King.
But on the whole it is a good sign that they should alter so
little, and looks like extreme caution and a dislike to rapid
and violent changes.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_04" id="FN_11_04"></a><a href="#FNA_11_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
They are altered. The first translation of the Charter which I read
was incorrect.</p></div>

<p>In the meantime we hear nothing of the old King, who
marches slowly on with his family. It has been reported in
London that Polignac is here, and also that he is taken.
Nobody knows the truth. I have heard of his behaviour,
however, which was worthy of his former imbecility. He
remained in the same presumptuous confidence up to the
last moment, telling those who implored him to retract while
it was still time that they did not know France, that he did,
that it was essentially Royalist, and all resistance would be
over in a day or two, till the whole ruin burst on him at
once, when he became like a man awakened from a dream,
utterly confounded with the magnitude of the calamity and
as pusillanimous and miserable as he had before been blind
and confident. It must be owned that their end has been
worthy of the rest, for not one of them has evinced good
feeling, or magnanimity, or courage in their fall, nor excited
the least sympathy or commiseration. The Duke of Fitzjames
made a good speech in the Chamber of Peers, and
Chateaubriand a very fine one a few days before, full of
eloquence in support of the claim of the Duke of Bordeaux
against that of Louis Philippe I.</p>

<p>In the meantime our elections here are still going against
Government, and the signs of the times are all for reform
and retrenchment, and against slavery. It is astonishing
the interest the people generally take in the slavery question,
which is the work of the Methodists, and shows the
enormous influence they have in the country. The Duke (for
I have not seen him) is said to be very easy about the next
Parliament, whereas, as far as one can judge, it promises to
be quite as unmanageable as the last, and is besides very ill
composed&mdash;full of boys and all sorts of strange men.</p>

<h3>August 20th, 1830</h3>

<p>On Monday to Stoke; Alvanley, Fitzroy
Somerset, Matuscewitz, Stanislas Potocki, Glengall, and Mornay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
were there. Lady Sefton (who had dined at the Castle a
few days before) asked the King to allow her to take Stanislas
Potocki to see Virginia Water in a carriage, which is not
allowed, but which his Majesty agreed to. Accordingly we
started, and going through the private drives, went up to the
door of the tent opposite the fishing-house. They thought it
was the Queen coming, or at any rate a party from the Castle,
for the man on board the little frigate hoisted all the colours,
and the boatmen on the other side got ready the royal barge
to take us across. We went all over the place on both sides,
and were delighted with the luxury and beauty of the whole
thing. On one side are a number of tents, communicating
together in separate apartments and forming a very good
house, a dining-room, drawing-room, and several other small
rooms, very well furnished; across the water is the fishing-cottage,
beautifully ornamented, with one large room and a
dressing-room on each side; the kitchen and offices are in a
garden full of flowers, shut out from everything. Opposite
the windows is moored a large boat, in which the band used
to play during dinner, and in summer the late King dined
every day either in the house or in the tents. We had
scarcely seen everything when Mr. Turner, the head keeper,
arrived in great haste, having spied us from the opposite side,
and very angry at our carriages having come there, which is
a thing forbidden; he did not know of our leave, nor could
we even satisfy him that we were not to blame.</p>

<p>The next day I called on Batchelor (he was <i>valet de
chambre</i> to the Duke of York, afterwards to George IV.),
who has an excellent apartment in the Lodge, which, he
said, was once occupied by Nell Gwynne, though I did not
know the lodge was built at that time. I was there a
couple of hours, and heard all the details of the late King&rsquo;s
illness and other things. For many months before his death
those who were about him were aware of his danger, but
nobody dared to say a word. The King liked to cheat
people with making them think he was well, and when he
had been at a Council he would return to his apartments
and tell his <i>valets de chambre</i> how he had deceived them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">GEORGE IV.&rsquo;S ILLNESS AND DEATH.</span>
During his illness he was generally cheerful, but occasionally
dejected, and constantly talked of his brother the Duke of
York, and of the similarity of their symptoms, and was
always comparing them. He had been latterly more civil
to Knighton than he used to be, and Knighton&rsquo;s attentions
to him were incessant; whenever he thought himself worse
than usual, and in immediate danger, he always sent for
Sir William. Lady Conyngham and her family went into
his room once a day; till his illness he always used to
go and sit in hers. It is true that last year, when she was
so ill, she was very anxious to leave the Castle, and it was
Sir William Knighton who with great difficulty induced her
to stay there. At that time she was in wretched spirits,
and did nothing but pray from morning till night. However,
her conscience does not seem ever to have interfered with
her ruling passion, avarice, and she went on accumulating.
During the last illness waggons were loaded every night and
sent away from the Castle, but what their contents were was
not known, at least Batchelor did not say. All Windsor knew
this. Those servants of the King who were about his person
had opportunities of hearing a great deal, for he used to talk
of everybody before them, and without reserve or measure.</p>

<p>This man Batchelor had become a great favourite with the
late King. The first of his pages, William Holmes, had for
some time been prevented by ill health from attending him.
Holmes had been with him from a boy, and was also a great
favourite; by appointments and perquisites he had as much
as 12,000&#8467;. or 14,000&#8467;. a year, but he had spent so much in
all sorts of debauchery and living like a gentleman that he
was nearly ruined. There seems to have been no end to the
<i>tracasseries</i> between these men; their anxiety to get what they
could out of the King&rsquo;s wardrobe in the last weeks, and their
dishonesty in the matter, were excessive, all which he told
me in great detail. The King was more than anybody the
slave of habit and open to impressions, and even when he
did not like people he continued to keep them about him
rather than change.</p>

<p>While I was at Stoke news came that Charles X. had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
arrived off Portsmouth. He has asked for an asylum in
Austria, but when once he has landed here he will not move
again, I dare say. The enthusiasm which the French Revolution
produced is beginning to give way to some alarm, and
not a little disgust at the Duke of Orleans&rsquo; conduct, who
seems anxious to assume the character of a Jacobin King,
affecting extreme simplicity and laying aside all the pomp
of royalty. I don&rsquo;t think it can do, and there is certainly
enough to cause serious disquietude for the future.</p>

<p>Sefton in the meantime told me that Brougham and
Lord Grey were prepared for a violent opposition, and that
they had effected a formal junction with Huskisson, being
convinced that no Government could now be formed without
him. I asked him if Palmerston was a party to this junction,
and he said he was, but the first thing I heard when I got
to town was that a negotiation is going on between Palmerston
and the Duke, and that the former takes every
opportunity of declaring his goodwill to the latter, and how
unshackled he is. Both these things can&rsquo;t be true, and time
will show which is. It seems odd that Palmerston should
abandon his party on the eve of a strong coalition, which is
not unlikely to turn out the present Administration, but it is
quite impossible to place any dependence upon public men
now-a-days. There is Lord Grey with his furious opposition,
having a little while ago supported the Duke in a sort of
way, having advised Rosslyn to take office, and now, because
his own vanity is hurt at not being invited to join the Government,
or more consulted at least, upon the slight pretext of the
Galway Bill in the last Parliament he rushes into rancorous
opposition, and is determined to give no quarter and listen to
no compromise. Brougham is to lead this Opposition in the
House of Commons, and Lord Grey in the Lords, and nothing
is to be done but as the result of general deliberation and
agreement. Brougham in the meantime has finished his
triumph at York in a miserable way, having insulted Martin
Stapylton on the hustings, who called him to account, and
then he forgot what he had said, and slunk away with a disclaimer
of unintentional offence, as usual beginning with intemperance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARLES X. IN ENGLAND.</span>
and ending with submission. His speeches were
never good, but at his own dinner he stated so many untruths
about the Duke of Wellington that his own partisans bawled
out &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; and it was a complete failure. His whole
spirit there was as bad as possible, paltry and commonplace.
That man, with all his talents, never can or will <i>do</i> in any
situation; he is base, cowardly, and unprincipled, and with
all the execrable judgment which, I believe, often flows from
the perversion of moral sentiment. Nobody can admire his
genius, eloquence, variety and extent of information, and the
charm of his society more than I do; but his faults are
glaring, and the effects of them manifest to anybody who
will compare his means and their results.</p>

<h3>August 23rd, 1830</h3>

<p>General Baudrand is come over with a
letter from King Louis Philippe to King William. He saw
the Duke and Aberdeen yesterday. Charles X. goes to Lulworth
Castle. What are called moderate people are greatly
alarmed at the aspect of affairs in France, but I think the law
(which will be carried) of abolishing capital punishment in
political cases is calculated to tranquillise men&rsquo;s minds everywhere,
for it draws such a line between the old and the new
Revolution. The Ministers will be tried and banished, but no
blood spilt. Lord Anglesey went to see Charles X., and told
him openly his opinion of his conduct. The King laid it all
upon Polignac. The people of Paris wanted to send over a
deputation to thank the English for their sympathy and
assistance&mdash;a sort of fraternising affair&mdash;but the King would
not permit it, which was wisely done, and it is a good thing
to see that he can curb in some degree that spirit; this
Vaudreuil told me last night. It would have given great
offence and caused great alarm here.</p>

<h3>August 24th, 1830</h3>

<p>Alvanley had a letter from Montrond
yesterday from Paris. He was with M. Molé when a letter
was brought him from Polignac, beginning, &lsquo;Mon cher
Collègue,&rsquo; and saying that he wrote to him to ask his
advice what he had better do, that he should have liked to
retire to his own estate, but it was too near Paris, that he
should like to go into Alsace, and that he begged he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
arrange it for him, and in the meantime send him some
boots, and shirts, and breeches.</p>

<p>The French King continues off Cowes, many people visiting
him. They came off without clothes or preparation of
any kind, so much so that Lady Grantham has been obliged
to furnish Mesdames de Berri and d&rsquo;Angoulême with everything;
it seems they have plenty of money. The King says
he and his son have retired from public life; and as to his
grandson, he must wait the progress of events; that his conscience
reproaches him with nothing.</p>

<p>The dinner in St. George&rsquo;s Hall on the King&rsquo;s birthday
was the finest thing possible&mdash;all good and hot, and served
on the late King&rsquo;s gold plate. There were one hundred
people at table. After dinner the King gave the Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s health, as it was the anniversary of Vimeiro;
the Dukes of Cumberland and Gloucester turned their
glasses down. I can&rsquo;t agree with Charles X. that it would
be better to &lsquo;<i>travailler pour son pain</i> than to be King of
England.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I went yesterday all over Lambeth Palace, which has
been nearly rebuilt by Blore, and admirably done; one of
the best houses I ever saw. Archbishop Juxon&rsquo;s Hall has
been converted into the library of the Palace, and is also a
fine thing in its way. It is not to cost above 40,000&#8467;. The
Lollards&rsquo; Tower, which is very curious with its iron rings, and
the names of the Lollards written on the walls, is not to be
touched.</p>

<p><i>At night</i>.&mdash;Went to Lady Glengall&rsquo;s to meet Marmont.
He likes talking of his adventures, but he had done his Paris
talk before I got there; however, he said a great deal about
old campaigning and Buonaparte, which, as well as I recollect,
I will put down.</p>

<p>As to the battle of Salamanca, he remarked that, without
meaning to detract from the glory of the English arms, he
was inferior in force there; our army was provided with everything,
well paid, and the country favourable, his &lsquo;dénuée de
tout,&rsquo; without pay, in a hostile country; that all his provisions
came from a great distance and under great escorts,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONVERSATION WITH MARSHAL MARMONT.</span>
and his communications were kept up in the same way. Of
Russia, he said that Buonaparte&rsquo;s army was destroyed by the
time he got to Moscow, destroyed by famine; that there were
two ways of making war, by slow degrees with magazines,
or by rapid movements and reaching places where abundant
means of supply and reorganisation were to be found, as he
had done at Vienna and elsewhere, but in Russia supplies were
not to be had. Napoleon had, however, pushed on with the
same rapidity and destroyed his army. Marshal Davoust (I
think, but am not sure) had a <i>corps d&rsquo;armée</i> of 80,000 men
and reached Moscow with 15,000; the cavalry were 50,000
sabres, at Moscow they were 6,000. Somebody asked him
if Napoleon&rsquo;s generals had not dissuaded him from going to
Russia. Marmont said no; they liked it; but Napoleon ought
to have stopped at Smolensk, made Poland independent, and
levied 50,000 Cossacks, the Polish Cossacks being better than
the Russian, who would have kept all his communications
clear, and allowed the French army to repose, and then he
would have done in two campaigns what he wished to accomplish
in one; instead of which he never would deal with
Poland liberally, but held back with ulterior views, and never
got the Poles cordially with him. Of the campaign of 1813 he
said that it was ill conducted by Napoleon and full of faults;
his creation of the army was wonderful, and the battle of
Dresden would have been a great movement if he had not
suddenly abandoned Vandamme after pushing him on to cut
off the retreat of the Allies. It was an immense fault to
leave all the garrisons in the Prussian and Saxon fortresses.
The campaign of 1814 was one of his most brilliant. He
(Marmont) commanded a <i>corps d&rsquo;armée</i>, and fought in most
of the celebrated actions, but he never had 4,000 men; at
Paris, which he said was &lsquo;the most honourable part of his
whole career,&rsquo; he had
7,500.<a name="FNA_11_05" id="FNA_11_05"></a><a href="#FN_11_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Napoleon committed a great
fault in throwing himself into the rear as he did; he should
have fallen back upon Paris, where his own presence would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
have been of vast importance, and sent Marmont into the
rear with what troops he could collect. I repeated what the
Duke of Wellington had once told me, that if the Emperor
had continued the same plan, and fallen back on Paris, he
would have obliged the Allies to retreat, and asked him what
he thought. He rather agreed with this, but said the Emperor
had conceived one of the most splendid pieces of strategy
that ever had been devised, which failed by the disobedience
of Eugene. He sent orders to Eugene to assemble his army, in
which he had 35,000 French troops, to amuse the Austrians
by a negotiation for the evacuation of Italy; to throw the
Italian troops into Alessandria and Mantua; to destroy the
other fortresses, and going by forced marches with his French
troops, force the passage of Mont Cenis, collect the scattered
<i>corps d&rsquo;armée</i> of Augereau (who was near Lyons) and another
French general, which would have made his force amount to
above 60,000 men, and burst upon the rear of the Allies so
as to cut off all their communications. These orders he sent
to Eugene, but Eugene &lsquo;rêvait d&rsquo;être roi d&rsquo;Italie après sa
chute,&rsquo; and he sent his aide-de-camp Tascher to excuse himself.
The movement was not made, and the game was up.
Lady Dudley Stewart was there, Lucien&rsquo;s daughter and
Buonaparte&rsquo;s niece. Marmont was presented to her, and she
heard him narrate all this; there is something very simple,
striking, and soldierlike in his manner and appearance. He
is going to Russia.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_05" id="FN_11_05"></a><a href="#FNA_11_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[This assertion of Marmont&rsquo;s is the more curious as it was to his
alleged treachery that Napoleon when at Fontainebleau chose to ascribe his
defeat.]</p></div>

<p>He was very communicative about events at Paris,
lamented his own ill-luck, involved in the business against
his wishes and feelings; he disapproved of Polignac and his
measures, and had no notion the <i>ordonnances</i> were thought of.
In the morning he was going to St. Germain for the day;
when his aide-de-camp brought him the newspaper with the
<i>ordonnances il tomba de son haut</i>. Soon after the Dauphin
sent to him to desire that, as there might be some
&lsquo;vitres cassées,&rsquo; he would take the command of the troops.
Directly after the thing began. He had 7,000 or 8,000 men;
not a preparation had been made of any sort; they had never
thought of resistance, had not consulted Marmont or any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CRADOCK&rsquo;S MISSION TO CHARLES X.</span>
military man; he soon found how hopeless the case was,
and sent eight estafettes to the King one after another
during the action to tell him so and implore him to stop
while it was time. They never returned any answer. He
then rode out to St. Cloud, where he implored the King to
yield. It was not till after seven hours&rsquo; pressing that he
consented to name M. de Mortemart Minister, but would not
withdraw the edicts. He says that up to Wednesday night
they would have compromised and accepted M. de Mortemart
and the suppression of the edicts, but the King still demurred.
On Wednesday night he yielded, but then the communications
were interrupted. That night the meeting at
the Palais Royal took place, at which the King&rsquo;s fate was
determined; and on Thursday morning when his offers
arrived, it was too late, and they would no longer treat.
Marmont said he had been treated with the greatest ingratitude
by the Court, and had taken leave of them for ever,
coldly of the King and Dauphin; the Duchess of Berri alone
shook hands with him and thanked him for his services and
fidelity. He says never man was so unlucky, that he was
<i>maréchal de quartier</i> and could not refuse to serve, but he
only acted on the defensive; 2,000 of the troops and 1,500
of the populace were killed. The Swiss did not behave well,
but the Lanciers de la Garde beautifully, and all the troops
were acting against their feelings and opinions. Marmont
said that Stuart had sent Cradock to Charles X. to desire
he would go as slowly as he could, to give time for a reaction
which he expected would take place. Cradock did go to the
King, but I rather doubt this
story.<a name="FNA_11_06" id="FNA_11_06"></a><a href="#FN_11_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_11_06" id="FN_11_06"></a><a href="#FNA_11_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
[Colonel Cradock (the late Lord Howden) was sent by the Ambassador
to the King, and had an audience at Rambouillet, but it was at
the request and instigation of the Duke of Orleans. The proposal entrusted
to Colonel Cradock was to the effect that the King and the Dauphin, having
abdicated, should quit France with the Princesses, but that Henry V. should
be proclaimed King under the regency of the Duke of Orleans. Louis
Philippe offered to support this arrangement, and to carry on the Government
as Regent, if Charles X. sanctioned it. The King received the communication
in bed. The Duchess of Angoulême was consulted, and vehemently
opposed the scheme, because, said she, speaking of the Orleans family, &lsquo;ils
sont toujours les mêmes,&rsquo; and she referred to the preposterous stories current
at the time of the death of the Duc de Bourgogne, and the regency of 1715.
The offer was therefore rejected. These facts were not known to Mr.
Greville at the time, nor till long afterwards, but they confirm his information
that &lsquo;Cradock <i>did</i> go to the King,&rsquo;]</p></div>

<h3>August 27th, 1830</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
At Court the day before yesterday; Parliament
was prorogued and summoned. General Baudrand
came afterwards and delivered his letter, also a private letter
&lsquo;from the Duke of Orleans to the Duke of Clarence&rsquo;&mdash;as the
French King called them, &lsquo;anciens amis.&rsquo; He was well
received and well satisfied. I never knew such a burst of
indignation and contempt as Polignac&rsquo;s letter has caused&mdash;a
letter to the President of the Chamber of Peers. As Dudley
says, it has saved history the trouble of crucifying that man,
and speaks volumes about the recent events. Such a man to
have been Prime Minister of France for a year!</p>

<h3>August 29th, 1830</h3>

<p>Dined with Dudley the day before yesterday
to meet Marmont, who is made very much of here by the
few people who are left. He had been to Woolwich in the
morning, where the Duke of Wellington had given orders
that everything should be shown to him, and the honours
handsomely done. He was very much gratified, and he
found the man who had pointed the gun which wounded
him at Salamanca, and who had since lost his own arm at
Waterloo. Marmont shook hands with him and said, &lsquo;Ah,
mon ami, chacun a son tour.&rsquo; Lady Aldborough came in
in the evening, and flew up to him with &lsquo;Ah, mon cher
Maréchal, embrassez-moi;&rsquo; and so after escaping the cannon&rsquo;s
mouth at Paris, he was obliged to face Lady Aldborough&rsquo;s
mouth here. This was my first dinner at Dudley&rsquo;s, brought
about <i>malgré lui</i> by Lady Glengall. He has always disliked
and never invited me, but now (to all appearance) we are
friends. He said he had been to see an old man who lives
near the world&rsquo;s end&mdash;Chelsea&mdash;who is 110 years old; he has
a good head of hair, with no grey hairs in it; his health,
faculties, and memory perfect; is Irish, and has not lived
with greater temperance than other people. I sat next to
Palmerston, and had a great deal of conversation with him,
and from the tenour of his language infer that he has no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DINNER AT LORD DUDLEY&rsquo;S.</span>
idea of joining Government. Agar Ellis assured me the
other day that there was not a word of truth in the reported
junction between Lord Grey and Huskisson. The Duke has
got two months to make his arrangements, but I am afraid he
is not prepared for all the sacrifices his position requires.
It is now said that the exasperation against the late Ministers
(particularly Polignac) is so great in France that it is doubtful
whether they will be able to save their lives.</p>

<h3>Stoke, August 31st, 1830</h3>

<p>On Sunday I met Prince
Esterhazy<a name="FNA_12_01" id="FNA_12_01"></a><a href="#FN_12_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
in Oxford Street with a face a yard long. He turned back
with me, and told me that there had been disturbances at
Brussels, but that they had been put down by the gendarmerie.
He was mightily alarmed, but said that his
Government would recognise the French King directly, and
in return for such general and prompt recognition as he was
receiving he must restrain France from countenancing revolutions
in other countries, and that, indeed, he had lost
no time in declaring his intention to abstain from any
meddling. In the evening Vaudreuil told me the same
thing, and that he had received a despatch from M. Molé
desiring him to refuse passports to the Spaniards who
wanted, on the strength of the French Revolution, to go
and foment the discontents in Spain, and to all other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WELLINGTON&rsquo;S FOREIGN POLICY.</span>
foreigners who, being dissatisfied with their own Governments,
could not obtain passports from their own Ministers.
Yesterday morning, however, it appeared that the affair at
Brussels was much more serious than Esterhazy had given
me to understand; and, as far as can be judged from the
unofficial statements which we have, it appears likely that
Belgium will separate from Holland altogether, it being very
doubtful whether the Belgian troops will support the King&rsquo;s
Government.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_01" id="FN_12_01"></a><a href="#FNA_12_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>

Falck<a name="FNA_12_02" id="FNA_12_02"></a><a href="#FN_12_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
has heard nothing. He left Holland before the outbreak.
In the event of such a revolution, it remains to be
seen what part Prussia will take, and, if she marches an
army to reduce Belgium to obedience, whether the Belgians
will not make overtures to France, and in that case whether
King Louis Philippe will be able to restrain the French from
seizing such a golden opportunity of regaining their former
frontier; and if they accept the offer, whether a general war
in Europe will not ensue.</p>

[Baron Falck, Dutch Minister at the Court of St. James.]</p></div>

<p>In these difficult circumstances, and in the midst of possibilities
so tremendous, it is awful to reflect upon the very
moderate portion of wisdom and sagacity which is allotted
to those by whom our affairs are managed. I am by no
means easy as to the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s sufficiency to
meet such difficulties; the habits of his mind are not those
of patient investigation, profound knowledge of human
nature, and cool, discriminating sagacity. He is exceedingly
quick of apprehension, but deceived by his own quickness
into thinking he knows more than he does. He has amazing
confidence in himself, which is fostered by the deference
of those around him and the long experience of his military
successes. He is upon ordinary occasions right-headed and
sensible, but he is beset by weaknesses and passions which
must, and continually do, blind his judgment. Above all he
wants that suavity of manner, that watchfulness of observation,
that power of taking great and enlarged views of
events and characters, and of weighing opposite interests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and probabilities, which are essentially necessary in circumstances
so delicate, and in which one false step, any hasty
measure, or even incautious expression, may be attended with
consequences of immense importance. I feel justified in this
view of his political fitness by contemplating the whole
course of his career, and the signal failure which has marked
all his foreign policy. If Canning were now alive we might
hope to steer through these difficulties, but if he had lived
we should probably never have been in them. He was the
only statesman who had sagacity to enter into and comprehend
the spirit of the times, and to put himself at the
head of that movement which was no longer to be arrested.
The march of Liberalism (as it is called) would not be
stopped, and this he knew, and he resolved to govern and
lead instead of opposing it. The idiots who so rejoiced at
the removal of this master mind (which alone could have
saved them from the effects of their own folly) thought to
stem the torrent in its course, and it has overwhelmed them.
It is unquestionable that the Duke has too much participated
in their sentiments and passions, and, though he never mixed
himself with their proceedings, regarded them with a favourable
eye, nor does he ever seem to have been aware of the
immensity of the peril which they were incurring. The
urgency of the danger will unquestionably increase the impatience
of those who already think the present Government
incapable of carrying on the public business, and now that
we are placed in a situation the most intricate (since the
French Revolution) it is by no means agreeable to think that
such enormous interests are at the mercy of the Duke&rsquo;s
awkward squad.</p>

<p>Sefton gave me an account of the dinner in St. George&rsquo;s
Hall on the King&rsquo;s birthday, which was magnificent&mdash;excellent
and well served.
Bridge<a name="FNA_12_03" id="FNA_12_03"></a><a href="#FN_12_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
came down with the plate,
and was hid during the dinner behind the great wine-cooler,
which weighs 7,000 ounces, and he told Sefton afterwards that
the plate in the room was worth 200,000&#8467;. There is another

service of gold plate, which was not used at all. The King
has made it all over to the Crown. All this plate was
ordered by the late King, and never used; his delight was
ordering what the public had to pay for.</p>

<h3>September 9th, 1830</h3>

<p>Came from Stoke the day after the
Egham races, and went to Brocket Hall on Saturday last;
returned the day before yesterday. Nothing can exceed the
interest, the excitement, the consternation which prevail
here. On Saturday last the funds suddenly fell near three
per cent.; no cause apparent, a thousand reports, and a panic
on the Stock Exchange. At last on Monday it appeared
that the Emperor of Russia had, on the first intelligence of
the revolution in France, prohibited the tricoloured cockade
and ordered all Russian subjects to quit France. As we
went down on Saturday Henry told me that there had been
alarming accounts from the manufacturing districts of a
disposition to rise on the part of the workmen, which had
kept Lord Hill in town; and this I fancied was the cause of
the fall, but it was the Russian business. They have since,
however, rallied to nearly what they were before. At Brocket
I had a long conversation with my
brother-in-law,<a name="FNA_12_04" id="FNA_12_04"></a><a href="#FN_12_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
who is
never very communicative or talkative, but he takes a
gloomy view of everything, not a little perhaps tinctured by
the impending ruin which he foresees to his own property
from the Liverpool Railroad, which is to be opened with great
ceremony on the 15th; moreover he thinks the Government
so weak that it cannot stand, and expects the Duke will be
compelled to resign. He has already offered him his place,
to dispose of in any way that may be useful to him. I said
that I thought one of the Duke&rsquo;s greatest misfortunes was
his having no wise head to consult with in all emergencies;
this he said was very true, for there was nobody who
would even speak to him about anything; that Peel, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
was the man who might naturally be expected to put himself
forward, never would; and that repeatedly he had got
him (Francis) to go to or write to the Duke about some
matter or other on which it was necessary to refer to him.
In the business of Huskisson, Huskisson himself was most
anxious to have it made up, and wished Peel to speak to the
Duke; but Peel would not stir, nor would Dudley, and it
ended in Francis&rsquo; being charged with the negotiation, the
result of which everybody knows.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_04" id="FN_12_04"></a><a href="#FNA_12_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[Lord Francis Egerton, afterwards First Earl of Ellesmere, proprietor
of the Bridgewater Estates and Canal, which was threatened by the competition
of the newly-made Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Lord
Francis held the office of Secretary at War in 1830 for a very short time,
having previously been Irish Secretary when Lord Anglesey was Lord
Lieutenant.]</p></div>

<p>In the meantime the affairs of Belgium are in a very
critical state; the Prince of Orange has entirely failed in
reducing the malcontents to submission, and after passing
two or three days at or near Brussels in fruitless negotiation
and the interchange of proud civilities, he was obliged to
retire and carry back to the King a proposal that Belgium
and Holland should be separated and a Federal Union
established between them. Last night, however, a proclamation
of the King appeared, well drawn up, and couched in
firm, temperate, and sensible language, in which he declares
that he will do all that the circumstances of the case may
render necessary, but that all shall be referred to the States-General,
and they shall decide upon the measures to be
adopted. This will probably excite great discontent, and it
is at least doubtful whether the Belgian Deputies will consent
to go to the Hague at all. My belief is that this proclamation
is the result of encouragement from Prussia.</p>

<p>The night before last I had a letter from the Duc de
Dalberg with a very sensible view of the state of France and
of affairs generally in Europe, auguring well of the stability
of the present Government, provided the other Powers of
Europe do nothing to disturb the general tranquillity. I
never was so astonished as when I read in the newspaper of
the appointment of Talleyrand to be Ambassador here. He
must be nearer eighty than seventy, and though his faculties
are said to be as bright as ever (which I doubt), his infirmities
are so great that it is inconceivable he should think of
leaving his own home, and above all for another country,
where public representation is unavoidable. Dalberg told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BAD PROSPECTS OF THE SESSION.</span>
me that several of the Ministers are going out&mdash;Guizot,
Marshal Gérard, and Baron Louis, the two latter <i>accablés</i>
with the <i>travail</i>, and the first unused to and unfit for official
business;<a name="FNA_12_05" id="FNA_12_05"></a><a href="#FN_12_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Louis is seventy-three.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_05" id="FN_12_05"></a><a href="#FNA_12_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[A curious estimate, taken at the time, of the man who for the next
eighteen years had a larger share of official life and business than any other
Frenchman.]</p></div>

<p>In the meantime the Duke does nothing here towards
strengthening his Government, and he will probably meet
Parliament as he is. There are some circumstances in his
favour, and I think it possible he may still extricate himself
from his difficulties. There is unquestionably a notion
amongst many persons (of the aristocracy) that he is the
only man to rely upon for governing this country in the
midst of difficulties. It is hard to say upon what this feeling
(for it is more of a feeling than an opinion) is founded; not
certainly upon any experience of his abilities for Government
either as to principles or the details of particular branches
of business, or his profound, dispassionate, and statesmanlike
sagacity, but upon certain vague predilections, and the confidence
which he has infused into others by his own firm,
manly, and even dictatorial character, and the recollection
of his military exploits and splendid career, which have not
yet lost their power over the minds of men, and to this
must be added his great influence over the late and present
sovereigns.</p>

<p>The short session which will begin on the 28th of
October will be occupied with the Regency and Civil List,
and it is probable that both those matters will be produced
in a form to give general satisfaction; that will be strength
as far as it goes. The Tories are alarmed at the general
aspect of affairs, and I doubt whether they will not forget
their ancient grievances and antipathies, and, if they do not
support the Government, abstain at least from any violent
opposition, the result of which could only be to let in the
Whigs, of whose principles they have the greatest apprehensions.
I can perfectly understand that there may be many
men who, wishing sincerely to see a stronger Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
formed, may think that any change at this moment which
may present to Europe a spectacle of disunion and weakness
here would be a greater evil than the temporary toleration
of such Ministers as ours; and if the Duke does find such
a disposition, and profits by it dexterously and temperately,
he may float through the next session, and at the end of it
negotiate with other parties on more advantageous terms
than he possibly could do now, when all his concessions
would appear to be extorted by force or by the urgent difficulties
of his position.</p>

<h3>September 10th, 1830</h3>

<p>The Duke is very much disturbed about
the state of affairs, thinks ill of France and generally of the
state of Europe. I think the alarmists are increasing everywhere,
and the signs of the times are certainly portentous;
still I doubt there being any great desire of change among
the mass of the people of England, and prudent and dexterous
heads (if there be any such) may still steer on through the
storm. If Canning were alive I believe he would have been
fully equal to the emergency if he was not thwarted by the
passions, prejudices, and follies of others; but if he had lived
we should not have had the Catholic question settled, and
what a state we should be in now if that were added to the rest!</p>

<h3>September 14th, 1830</h3>

<p>Last Saturday to Panshanger; returned
yesterday with Melbourne, George Lamb, and the
Ashleys. George said there would be a violent Opposition
in the approaching session.
William<a name="FNA_12_06" id="FNA_12_06"></a><a href="#FN_12_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
told me he thought
Huskisson was the greatest practical statesman he had
known, the one who united theory with practice the most,
but owned he was not popular and not thought honest;
that his remaining in with the Duke when Goderich&rsquo;s
Ministry was dissolved was a fatal error, which he could
never repair.</p>

[William Lamb, second Lord Melbourne, afterwards Prime Minister.]</p></div>

<p>I found Sefton in town last night, and went to the play
with him. He has had a letter from Brougham, who told
him he should go to the Liverpool dinner and attack the
Duke of Wellington; that it was the only opportunity he
should ever have in his life of meeting him face to face, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEATH OF MR. HUSKISSON.</span>
he then proceeded to relate all that he should say. Sefton
wrote him word that if he said half what he intended the chairman
would order him to be turned out of the room. He won&rsquo;t
go, I am persuaded.</p>

<h3>Newark, September 18th, 1830</h3>

<p>Went back to Panshanger last
Tuesday; found there Madame de Lieven, Melbourne, and
the Hollands and Allen. Lord Holland was very agreeable, as
he always is, and told many anecdotes of George Selwyn,
Lafayette, and others. I saw them arrive in a coach-and-four
and chaise-and-pair&mdash;two footmen, a page, and two maids.
He said (what is true) that there is hardly such a thing in the
world as a good house or a good epitaph, and yet mankind
have been employed in building the former and writing the
latter since the beginning almost. Came to town on Thursday,
and in the afternoon heard the news of Huskisson&rsquo;s
horrible accident, and yesterday morning got a letter from
Henry with the details, which are pretty correctly given in
the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; newspaper. It is a very odd thing, but I had
for days before a strong presentiment that some terrible
accident would occur at this ceremony, and I told Lady
Cowper so, and several other people. Nothing could exceed
the horror of the few people in London at this event,
or the despair of those who looked up to him politically.
It seems to have happened in this way:&mdash;While the Duke&rsquo;s
car was stopping to take in water, the people alighted and
walked about the railroad; when suddenly another car, which
was running on the adjoining level, came up. Everybody
scrambled out of the way, and those who could got again
into the first car. This Huskisson attempted to do, but he
was slow and awkward; as he was getting in some part of
the machinery of the other car struck the door of his, by
which he was knocked down. He was taken up, and conveyed
by Wilton<a name="FNA_12_07" id="FNA_12_07"></a><a href="#FN_12_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
and Mrs. Huskisson (who must have seen
the accident happen) to the house of Mr. Blackburne, eight
miles from Heaton. Wilton saved his life for a few hours by
knowing how to tie up the artery; amputation was not
possible, and he expired at ten o&rsquo;clock that night. Wilton,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Lord Granville, and Littleton were with him to the last.
Mrs. Huskisson behaved with great courage. The Duke of
Wellington was deeply affected, and it was with the greatest
difficulty he could be induced to proceed upon the progress to
Manchester, and at last he only yielded to the most pressing
solicitations of the directors and others, and to a strong remonstrance
that the mob might be dangerous if he did not
appear. It is impossible to figure to one&rsquo;s self any event
which could produce a greater sensation or be more striking
to the imagination than this, happening at such a time and
under such circumstances: the eminence of the man, the
sudden conversion of a scene of gaiety and splendour into
one of horror and dismay; the countless multitudes present,
and the effect upon them&mdash;crushed to death in sight of his
wife and at the feet (as it was) of his great political rival&mdash;all
calculated to produce a deep and awful impression. The
death of Huskisson cannot fail to have an important effect
upon political events; it puts an end to his party as a party,
but it leaves the survivors at liberty to join either the Opposition
or the Government, while during his life there were
great difficulties to their doing either, in consequence of the
antipathy which many of the Whigs had to him on one side
and the Duke of Wellington on the other. There is no use,
however, in speculating on what will happen, which a very
short time will show.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_07" id="FN_12_07"></a><a href="#FNA_12_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[Thomas Grosvenor Egerton, second Earl of Wilton.]</p></div>

<p>Agar Ellis told me yesterday morning that he had
received a letter from Brougham a day or two ago, in which
he said that he was going to Liverpool, and hoped there to
sign a treaty with Huskisson, so that it is probable they
would have joined to oppose the Government. As to the
Duke of Wellington, a fatality attends him, and it is perilous
to cross his path. There were perhaps 500,000 people
present on this occasion, and probably not a soul besides
hurt. One man only is killed, and that man is his most
dangerous political opponent, the one from whom he had
most to fear. It is the more remarkable because these great
people are generally taken such care of, and put out of the
chance of accidents. Canning had scarcely reached the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF HUSKISSON.</span>
zenith of his power when he was swept away, and the field
was left open to the Duke, and no sooner is he reduced
to a state of danger and difficulty than the ablest of his
adversaries is removed by a chance beyond all power of
calculation.</p>

<p>Huskisson was about sixty years old, tall, slouching, and
ignoble-looking. In society he was extremely agreeable,
without much animation, generally cheerful, with a great
deal of humour, information, and anecdote, gentlemanlike,
unassuming, slow in speech, and with a downcast look, as if
he avoided meeting anybody&rsquo;s gaze. I have said what Melbourne
thought of him, and that was the opinion of his
party. It is probably true that there is no man in Parliament,
or perhaps out of it, so well versed in finance, commerce,
trade, and colonial matters, and that he is therefore a
very great and irreparable loss. It is nevertheless remarkable
that it is only within the last five or six years that he acquired
the great reputation which he latterly enjoyed. I do not
think he was looked upon as more than a second-rate man
till his speeches on the silk trade and the shipping interest;
but when he became President of the Board of Trade he devoted
himself with indefatigable application to the maturing and
reducing to practice those commercial improvements with
which his name is associated, and to which he owes all his
glory and most of his unpopularity. It is equally true that
all the ablest men in the country coincide with him, and that
the mass of the community are persuaded that his plans are
mischievous to the last degree. The man whom he consulted
through the whole course of his labours and enquiries was
Hume,<a name="FNA_12_08" id="FNA_12_08"></a><a href="#FN_12_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
who is now in the Board of Trade, and whose vast experience
and knowledge were of incalculable service to him.
Great as his abilities unquestionably were, it is impossible to
admire his judgment, which seems repeatedly to have failed
him, particularly in his joining the Duke&rsquo;s Government on
Goderich&rsquo;s resignation, which was a capital error, his speech
afterwards at Liverpool and his subsequent quarrel with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Duke. In all these cases he acted with the greatest imprudence,
and he certainly contrived, without exposing himself
to any specific charge, to be looked upon as a statesman of
questionable honour and integrity; and of this his friends as
well as his enemies were aware. As a speaker in the House of
Commons he was luminous upon his own subject, but he had
no pretensions to eloquence; his voice was feeble and his
manner ungraceful; however, he was (unfortunately) one of
the first men in the House, and was listened to with attention
upon any subject. He left no children. Mrs. Huskisson
has a pension of 1,200&#8467;. a year. The accounts from Paris
improve, inasmuch as there seems a better prospect than
there has been lately of tranquillity in the country. Sneyd
writes word that there is little doubt but that the Duc de
Bourbon was
assassinated.<a name="FNA_12_09" id="FNA_12_09"></a><a href="#FN_12_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

Suspicion pointed to Madame de Fenchères, his mistress, as privy to the

but the bulk of his vast property, including Chantilly, was bequeathed to
the Duc d&rsquo;Aumale, fourth son of King Louis Philippe. The Duc de Bourbon

for 3,000&#8467;. before his match, and he refused; he offered it
after, and they refused. There were a number of beautiful
women there&mdash;my cousin Mrs. Foljambe, Misses Mary and
Fanny Brandling the best. Came here on Friday night, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">HUSKISSON&rsquo;S LAST MOMENTS.</span>
found as usual a large party, but rather dull; Granvilles,
Newboroughs, Wharncliffes, G. Seymours, Sir J. and Lady
Fitzgerald (very pretty), Talbots, Madame Bathiany, Beaumonts,
G. Lamb. Yesterday Brougham came with his
brother, sister, and daughter-in-law, in the highest spirits and
state of excitement, going about Yorkshire, dining and
speechifying; he was at Doncaster too. Lord Granville was
just returned from Huskisson&rsquo;s funeral at Liverpool. It was
attended by a great multitude, who showed every mark of
respect and feeling. He died the death of a great man,
suffering torments, but always resigned, calm, and collected;
took the Sacrament, and made a codicil to his will, said the
country had had the best of him, and that he could not have
been useful for many more years, hoped he had never committed
any political sins that might not be easily forgiven,
and declared that he died without a feeling of ill-will and
in charity with all men. As he lay there he heard the guns
announcing the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s arrival at Manchester,
and he said, &lsquo;I hope to God the Duke may get safe through
the day.&rsquo; When he had done and said all he desired, he
begged they would open a vein and release him from his
pain. From the beginning he only wished to die quickly.
Mrs. Huskisson was violently opposed to his being buried at
Liverpool, and it was with great difficulty she was persuaded
to consent to the repeated applications that were made to her
for that purpose.</p>

<h3>Buckenham, October 25th, 1830</h3>

<p>A month nearly since I have
written a line; always racing and always idleness. Went
from Chatsworth to Heaton Park; an immense party, excellent
house and living, and very good sport for the sort of
thing in a park, with gentlemen riders.</p>

<p>I have lost sight of politics, and know nothing of what is
going on, except that all things look gloomy, and people
generally are alarmed. Last week the Arbuthnots were at
Cheveley, and I had a curious conversation enough with him.
I told him that I was desirous of the success of the Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s Administration, but felt strongly the necessity
of his getting rid of many of his present Cabinet, who were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
both inefficient and odious, that I thought one great misfortune
was that he had nobody to tell him the truth, and
very few men with whom he was on terms of confidential
cordiality. He owned it was so, but said that <i>he</i> never concealed
from him disagreeable truths&mdash;on the contrary, told
him everything&mdash;and assured me that at any time he would
tell the Duke anything that I thought he ought to know. I
told him to give him a notion how meanly Aberdeen was
thought of, that Alvanley had told Talleyrand not to notice
him, but to go at once to the Duke when he had any important
business to transact, and that he might tell the Duke
this if he pleased, but no one else. He said he would, and
then he began to talk of Peel, lamenting that there was
nothing like intimate confidence between the Duke and him,
and that the Duke was in fact ignorant of his real and secret
feelings and opinions; that to such a degree did Peel carry
his reserve, that when they were out of office, and it had
been a question of their returning to it, he had gone to meet
Peel at Lord Chandos&rsquo;s for the express purpose of finding
out what his opinions were upon the then state of affairs,
and that after many conversations he had come away
knowing no more of his sentiments and disposition than
before they met. I said that with a Cabinet like this, and
the House of Commons in the hands of Peel, I could not
imagine anything more embarrassing; he owned it was,
and then complained of Peel&rsquo;s indisposition to encourage
other men in the House of Commons, or to suffer the transaction
of business to pass through any hands but his own;
that the Duke had been accused of a grasping ambition and
a desire to do everything himself, whereas such an accusation
would be much more applicable to Peel. All this proves how
little real cordiality there is between these two men, and that,
though they are now necessary to each other, a little matter
would sever their political connection.</p>

<p>Here we have an American of the name of Powell, who
was here nineteen years ago, when he was one of the handsomest
men that ever was seen, and lived in the society
of Devonshire House. Three years of such a life spoilt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WELLINGTON&rsquo;S DECLARATION AGAINST REFORM.</span>
him, as he confesses, for the nineteen which followed in his
native country; and now he is come back with a wife
and five children to see the town he recollects become a
thousand times more beautiful, and the friends who have
forgotten him equally changed, but as much for the worse
as London is for the better; he seems a sensible, good sort
of fellow.</p>

<p>Baring told me the other day that he remembered his
(B.&rsquo;s) father with nearly nothing, and that out of the house
which he founded not less than six or seven millions must
have been taken. Several colossal fortunes have been made
out of it.</p>

<h3>London, November 8th, 1830</h3>

<p>Went from Buckenham to
Euston, and then back to Newmarket, where I never have
time or inclination to write or read. Parliament met, and a
great clamour was raised against the King&rsquo;s Speech, without
much reason; but it was immediately evident that the
Government was in a very tottering condition, and the first
night of this session the Duke of Wellington made a violent
and uncalled-for declaration against Reform, which has without
doubt sealed his fate. Never was there an act of more
egregious folly, or one so universally condemned by friends
and foes. The Chancellor said to Lady Lyndhurst after the
first night&rsquo;s debate in the House of Lords, &lsquo;You have often
asked me why the Duke did not take in Lord Grey; read
these two speeches (Lord Grey&rsquo;s and the Duke&rsquo;s), and then
you will see why. Do you think he would like to have a
colleague under him, who should get up and make such a
speech after such another as his?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The effect produced by this declaration exceeds anything
I ever saw, and it has at once destroyed what little popularity
the Duke had left, and lowered him in public estimation
so much that when he does go out of office, as most
assuredly he must, he will leave it without any of the dignity
and credit which might have accompanied his retirement.
The sensation produced in the country has not yet been
ascertained, but it is sure to be immense. I came to town
last night, and found the town ringing with his imprudence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and everybody expecting that a few days would produce his
resignation.</p>

<p>The King&rsquo;s visit to the City was regarded with great
apprehension, as it was suspected that attempts would be
made to produce riot and confusion at night, and consequently
all the troops that could be mustered were prepared,
together with thousands of special constables, new
police, volunteers, sailors, and marines; but last night a
Cabinet Council was held, when it was definitively arranged
to put it off altogether, and this morning the announcement
has appeared in the newspapers. Every sort of ridicule
and abuse was heaped upon the Government, the Lord
Mayor, and all who had any share in putting off the
King&rsquo;s visit to the City; very droll caricatures were circulated.</p>

<p>I met Matuscewitz last night, who was full of the Duke
and his speech, and of regrets at his approaching fall, which
he considers as the signal for fresh encroachments in France
by the Liberal party, and a general impulse to the revolutionary
factions throughout Europe. I hear that nothing
can exceed the general excitement and terror that prevails,
everybody feeling they hardly know what.</p>

<h3>November 9th, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning I sallied forth and
called on Arbuthnot, whom I did not find at home, but Mrs.
Arbuthnot was. I had previously called on the Villiers, and
had a long conversation about the state of everything. They
did not apprise me of anything new, but
Hyde,<a name="FNA_12_12" id="FNA_12_12"></a><a href="#FN_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
who ought
to be informed, gave me an account of the resolutions which
Brougham means to propose, very different from what I heard
elsewhere. He said that they were very strong, whereas all
other accounts agree that they are very moderate. I walked
with Mrs. Arbuthnot down to Downing Street, and, as she
utters the Duke&rsquo;s sentiments, was anxious to hear what she
would say about their present condition. I said, &lsquo;Well, you
are in a fine state; what do you mean to do?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, are you
alarmed? Well, I am not; everybody says we are to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISTURBANCES IN LONDON.</span>
out, and I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. They will be beat on
the question of Reform; people will return to the Government,
and we shall go on very well. You will see this will be the
end of it.&rsquo; I told her I did not believe they could stay in,
and attacked the Duke&rsquo;s speech, which at last she owned she
was sorry he had made. She complained that they had no
support, and that everybody they took in became useless as
soon as they were in office&mdash;Ellenborough, Rosslyn, Murray.
It was evident, however, that she did contemplate their loss
of office as a very probable event, though they do not mean
to resign, and think they may stave off the evil day. In
Downing Street we met George Dawson, who told us the
funds had fallen three per cent., and that the panic was
tremendous, so much so that they were not without alarm
lest there should be a run on the Bank for gold. Later in
the day, however, the funds improved. In the House of
Lords I heard the Duke&rsquo;s explanation of putting off the
dinner in the City. On the whole they seem to have done
well to put it off, but the case did not sound a strong one;
it rested on a letter from the Lord Mayor telling the Duke
an attempt would be made on his life. Still it is a hundred
to one that there would have been a riot, and possibly all its
worst evils and crimes. The King is said to be very low,
hating Reform, desirous of supporting the Duke, but feeling
that he can do nothing. However, in the House of Lords
last night the speakers vied with each other in praising his
Majesty and extolling his popularity. Lady Jersey told me
that the Duke had said to her, &lsquo;Lord, I shall not go out; you
will see we shall go on very well.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_12" id="FN_12_12"></a><a href="#FNA_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a>
[Thomas Hyde Villiers, brother of George, afterwards fourth Earl of
Clarendon, died in 1832.]</p></div>

<h3>November 10th, 1830</h3>

<p>It was expected last night that there
would be a great riot, and preparations were made to meet
it. Troops were called up to London, and a large body of
civil power put in motion. People had come in from the
country in the morning, and everything indicated a disturbance.
After dinner I walked out to see how things were
going on. There was little mob in the west end of the town,
and in New Street, Spring Gardens, a large body of the new
police was drawn up in three divisions, ready to be employed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
if wanted. The Duke of Wellington expected Apsley
House to be attacked, and made preparations accordingly.
He desired my brother to go and dine there, to assist in
making any arrangements that might be necessary. In Pall
Mall I met Mr. Glyn, the banker, who had been up to Lombard
Street to see how matters looked about his house, and
he told us (Sir T. Farquhar and me) that everything was
quiet in the City. One of the policemen said that there
had been a smart brush near Temple Bar, where a body of
weavers with iron crows and a banner had been dispersed by
the police, and the banner taken. The police, who are a
magnificent set of fellows, behave very well, and it seems
pretty evident that these troubles are not very serious, and
will soon be put an end to. The attack in Downing Street
the night before last, of which they made a great affair,
turned out to be nothing at all. The mob came there from
Carlile&rsquo;s lecture, but the sentry stopped them near the
Foreign Office; the police took them in flank, and they all
ran away.</p>

<p>I went to Brooks&rsquo;s, but there was hardly anybody
there, and nothing occurred in the House of Commons but
some interchange of Billingsgate between O&rsquo;Connell and
George Dawson. The Duke talks with confidence, and has
no idea of resigning, but he does not inspire his friends with
the confidence he feels or affects himself, though they talk
of his resignation as an event which is to plunge all Europe
into war, and of the impossibility of forming another Administration,
all which is mere balderdash, for he proved
with many others how easy it is to form a Government that
can go on; and as to our Continental relations being altered,
I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. He may have influence abroad,
but he owes it not to his own individual character, but to his
possession of power in England. If the Ministry who succeed
him are firm and moderate, this country will lose nothing of
its influence abroad. I have heard these sort of things said
fifty times of Ministers and Kings. The death of the late
King was to be the greatest of calamities, and the breath
was hardly out of his body before everybody discovered that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUCHESSE DE DINO.</span>
it was the greatest of blessings, and, instead of its being impossible
to go on without him, that there would have been
no going on with him.</p>

<p>The King gave a dinner to the Prince of Orange the
other day, and invited all his old military friends to meet
him. His Majesty was beyond everything civil to the Duke
of Wellington, and the Queen likewise. Lord Wellesley,
speaking of the letter to the Lord Mayor, and putting off
the dinner in the City, said &lsquo;it was the boldest act of cowardice
he had ever heard of.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After some difficulty they have agreed to give Madame
de Dino<a name="FNA_12_13" id="FNA_12_13"></a><a href="#FN_12_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
the honours of Ambassadress here, the Duke having
told the King that at Vienna she did the honours of Talleyrand&rsquo;s
house, and was received on that footing by the Emperor
and Empress, so he said, &lsquo;Oh, very well; I will tell the
Queen, and you had better tell her too.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_13" id="FN_12_13"></a><a href="#FNA_12_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
[The Duchesse de Dino was the niece of Prince Talleyrand, then
French Ambassador at the Court of St. James. The precedent is a curious
one, for it is certainly not customary for the daughter or niece of an unmarried
Ambassador to enjoy the rank and honours of an Ambassadress.]</p></div>

<p>They say the King is exceedingly bullied by the <i>bâtards</i>,
though Errol told me they were all afraid of him. Dolly
Fitzclarence lost 100&#8467;., betting 100 to 10 that he would go
to Guildhall, and he told the King he had lost him 100&#8467;., so
the King gave him the money. It seems that the Duke
certainly did make some overtures to Palmerston, though I
do not exactly know when, but I heard that they were very
fair ones.</p>

<h3>November 11th, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday the funds rose, and people&rsquo;s
apprehensions began to subside. Everybody is occupied with
speculating about the numbers on Tuesday next, and what
majority the Ministers will get. Yesterday came a letter
from Lord Heytesbury from
St. Petersburg,<a name="FNA_12_14" id="FNA_12_14"></a><a href="#FN_12_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
saying that there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
was reason to believe that the disorder now raging in Russia
is a sort of plague, but that they will not admit it, and that
it is impossible to get at the truth. We ordered Russian
ships to be put under a precautionary quarantine, and made
a minute to record what we had done.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_14" id="FN_12_14"></a><a href="#FNA_12_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
[This is the first mention of the cholera morbus, or Asiatic cholera,
then first appearing in Europe. The quarantine establishments are under
the control of the Privy Council, and Mr. Greville, as Clerk of the Council,
was actively employed in superintending them. A Board of Health was
afterwards established at the Council Office during the prevalence of the
cholera.]</p></div>

<h3>November 12th, 1830</h3>

<p>The funds have kept advancing, everything
is quiet, and Ministers begin to take courage. The
Duke means if he has a majority of twenty on Tuesday to
stay in. It seems his idea is that the resolutions of Brougham
will be framed in general terms on purpose to obtain
as many votes as possible; that they will be no test of the
real opinion of the House, because most of those who may
concur in a general resolution in favour of Reform would
disagree entirely as to specific measures, if any were introduced;
but it is evident that the support of the Duke&rsquo;s
friends is growing feebler every day. Yesterday morning
I met Robert Clive, a thick and thin Government man,
and he began with the usual topic, for everybody asks
after the State, as one does about a sick friend; and
then he went on to say (concurring with my opinion that
everything went on ill), &lsquo;Why won&rsquo;t the Duke strengthen
himself?&rsquo; &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t; he has tried, and you see he can&rsquo;t do
anything.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah! but he must make sacrifices; things cannot
go on as they do, and he must make sacrifices.&rsquo; Lord Bath,
too, came to town, intending to leave his proxy with the
Duke, and went away with it in his pocket, after hearing his
famous speech; though he has a close borough, which he by
no means wishes to lose, still he is for Reform. What they
all feel is that his obstinacy will endanger everything; that
by timely concession, and regulating the present spirit, real
improvements might be made and extreme measures avoided.
I met Rothschild coming out of Herries&rsquo; room, with his
nephew from Paris. He looked pretty lively for a man who
has lost some millions, but the funds were all up yesterday;
he asked me the news, and said Lafitte was the best Minister
France could have, and that everything was rapidly improving
there.</p>

<h3>November 15th, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning I breakfasted with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ROBERT SOUTHEY.</span>
Taylor<a name="FNA_12_15" id="FNA_12_15"></a><a href="#FN_12_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
to meet Southey: the party was Southey; Strutt,
member for Derby, a Radical; young Mill, a political economist;
Charles Villiers, young Elliot, and myself. Southey
is remarkably pleasing in his manner and appearance, unaffected,
unassuming, and agreeable; at least such was my
impression for the hour or two I saw him. Young Mill is
the son of Mill who wrote the &lsquo;History of British India,&rsquo; and
said to be cleverer than his father. He has written many
excellent articles in reviews, pamphlets, &amp;c., but though
powerful with a pen in his hand, in conversation he has
not the art of managing his ideas, and is consequently
hesitating and slow, and has the appearance of being always
working in his mind propositions or a syllogism.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_15" id="FN_12_15"></a><a href="#FNA_12_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a>
[Henry Taylor, the author of &lsquo;Philip van Artevelde.&rsquo; Edward Strutt
was afterwards created Lord Belper. &lsquo;Young Mill&rsquo; was the eminent economist
and philosopher John Stuart Mill. &lsquo;Young Elliot,&rsquo; Sir Thomas
Frederick Elliot, K.S.M.G., long one of the ablest members of the Colonial
Department, to which Henry Taylor, the poet, himself belonged.]</p></div>

<p>Southey told an anecdote of Sir Massey Lopes, which is
a good story of a miser. A man came to him and told him
he was in great distress, and 200&#8467;. would save him. He
gave him a draft for the money.&rsquo; &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;what will
you do with this?&rsquo; &lsquo;Go to the bankers and get it cashed.&rsquo;
&lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;I will cash it.&rsquo; So he gave him the money,
but first calculated and deducted the discount, thus at once
exercising his benevolence and his avarice.</p>

<p>Another story Taylor told (we were talking of the negroes
and savages) of a girl (in North America) who had been
brought up for the purpose of being eaten on the day her
master&rsquo;s son was married or attained a certain age. She
was proud of being the <i>plat</i> for the occasion, for when she
was accosted by a missionary, who wanted to convert her to
Christianity and withdraw her from her fate, she said she had
no objection to be a Christian, but she must stay to be eaten,
that she had been fattened for the purpose and must fulfil
her destiny.</p>

<p>When I came home I found a note to say my unfortunate
colleague Buller<a name="FNA_12_16" id="FNA_12_16"></a><a href="#FN_12_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
was dead. He had had an operation performed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
on his lip, after which he caught cold, got an inflammation
in the windpipe, and died in two or three days. He
was a very honourable, obliging, and stupid man, and a great
loss to me, for I shall hardly find a more accommodating
colleague.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_16" id="FN_12_16"></a><a href="#FNA_12_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
[James Buller, Esq., senior Clerk of the Council.]</p></div>

<p>In the evening I dined with Lord Sefton to meet Talleyrand
and Madame de Dino. There were Brougham and
Denman, the latter brought by the former to show Talleyrand
to him. After dinner Talleyrand held a circle and
discoursed, but I did not come in for his talk. They were
all delighted, but long experience has proved to me that
people are easily delighted with whatever is in vogue.
Brougham is very proud of his French, which is execrable,
and took the opportunity of holding forth in a most barbarous
jargon, which he fancied was the real accent and phraseology.
He told me he should have 250 votes on his motion. I said
to him, &lsquo;They think they shall have a majority of 150.&rsquo; He
said, &lsquo;Then there must be 650 to divide, for at the lowest
computation I shall have 250.&rsquo; But at night Henry told
me that the Duke, though he put a good face on it, was
in fact very low, and that, from what Gosh [Arbuthnot]
had said, he would certainly resign unless he carried the
question by a large majority. In the morning I called on
Lady Granville, who told me, as a great secret, that the Duke,
notwithstanding his speech, was prepared to offer a compromise,
and her story was this:&mdash;She had dined at Ludolf&rsquo;s
a few days ago to meet the Duchesse de Berri. All the
great people dined there, among others the Chancellor and
Lady Lyndhurst, and after dinner Lady Lyndhurst came
up to her bursting with indignation, and confided to her
that the Duke had resolved to offer a resolution to the
effect that in any future case of borough delinquency the
representation should be transferred to a great town, and
that she thought after what had passed this would be so
disgraceful that it disgusted her beyond expression, and a
great deal more to this effect. I confess I don&rsquo;t believe a
word of it. I met the Prince of Orange last night in excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEFEAT OF THE WELLINGTON MINISTRY.</span>
spirits and humour, and quite convinced that he will
be recalled to Brussels.</p>

<h3>November 16th, 1830</h3>

<p>The Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s Administration
is at an end. If he has not already resigned, he probably
will do so in the course of the day. Everybody was so
intent on the Reform question that the Civil List was not
thought of, and consequently the defeat of Government last
night was unexpected. Although numbers of members were
shut out there was a great attendance, and a majority of
twenty-nine. Of those who were shut out, almost all declare
that they meant to have voted in the
majority.<a name="FNA_12_17" id="FNA_12_17"></a><a href="#FN_12_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_17" id="FN_12_17"></a><a href="#FNA_12_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
[The division was taken on Sir Henry Parnell&rsquo;s motion to refer the
Civil List to a Select Committee, which was carried by 233 to 204.]</p></div>

<p>I went to Mrs. Taylor&rsquo;s at night and found Ferguson,
Denman, and Taylor, who had just brought the news. The
exultation of the Opposition was immense. Word was sent
down their line not to cheer, but they were not to be restrained,
and Sefton&rsquo;s yell was heard triumphant in the din.
The Tories voted with them. There had been a meeting at
Knatchbull&rsquo;s in the morning, when they decided to go
against Government. Worcester had dined at Apsley
House, and returned with the news, but merely said that they
had had a bad division&mdash;twenty-nine. Everybody thought
he meant a majority <i>for</i> Government, and the Duke, who
already knew what had happened, made a sign to him to say
nothing. Worcester knew nothing himself, having arrived
after the division; they told him the numbers, and he came
away fancying they were for Government. So off the company
went to Madame de Dino, where they heard the truth.
Great was the consternation and long were the faces, but the
outs affected to be merry and the ins were serious. Talleyrand
fired off a courier to Paris forthwith.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I went to Downing Street early, to
settle with Lord Bathurst about the new appointment to my
office. Till I told him he did not know the appointment was
in the Crown; so he hurried off to the King, and proposed his
son William. The King was very gracious, and said, &lsquo;I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
never object to a father&rsquo;s doing what he can for his own
children,&rsquo; which was an oblique word for the <i>bâtards</i>, about
whom, however, it may be said <i>en passant</i> he has been marvellously
forbearing.</p>

<p>I had a long conversation with Lady Bathurst, who told
me that the Duke had resolved to stand or fall on the Reform
question, that he had asked Lord Bathurst&rsquo;s opinion, who
had advised him by all means to do so; that Lord Bathurst
had likewise put his own place at the Duke&rsquo;s disposal long
before, and was ready to resign at any moment. It is clear
that Lord Bathurst had some suspicion that the Duke had
an idea of not standing or falling by that question, for he
asked him whether anybody had given him different advice,
to which he replied, though it seems rather vaguely, &lsquo;No, oh
no; I think you are quite right.&rsquo; I told her the substance of
what I had heard about his being disposed to a compromise.
She said it was quite impossible, that he would be disgraced
irredeemably, but owned it was odd that there should be
that notion and the suspicion which crossed Lord Bathurst&rsquo;s
mind. I do think it is possible, but for his honour I hope
not. The Bathursts felt this appointment of William was a
sort of &lsquo;Nunc dimittis,&rsquo; but there is yet something between
the cup and the lip, for Stanley got up in the House of Commons
and attacked the appointment, and it is just possible
it may yet be stopped.</p>

<p>Went to Brookes&rsquo; in the evening, where there was nobody
left but Sefton baiting Ferguson for having been out of the
division. He told me that it was not impossible Lord
Spencer would be put at the head of Government. They
will manage to make a confounded mess of it, I dare say.
Billy Holmes came to the Duke last night with the news of
the division, and implored him to let nothing prevent his
resigning to-day.</p>

<h3>November 17th, 1830</h3>

<p>Went to Downing Street yesterday
morning between twelve and one, and found that the Duke
and all the Ministers were just gone to the King. He received
them with the greatest kindness, shed tears, but accepted
their resignation without remonstrance. He told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING&rsquo;S BEHAVIOUR AT THE CRISIS.</span>
Lord Bathurst he would do anything he could, and asked
him if there was nothing he could sign which would secure
his son&rsquo;s appointment. Lord Bathurst thanked him, but
told him he could do nothing. The fact is the appointment
might be hurried through, but the salary depends upon an
annual vote of the House of Commons, and an exasperated
and triumphant Opposition would be sure to knock it off; so
he has done the only thing he can do, which is to leave it
to the King to secure the appointment for him if possible.
It will be a great piece of luck for somebody that Buller
should have died exactly when he did. William Bathurst
may perhaps lose the place from his not dying earlier, or the
new Government may lose the patronage because he did not
die later; but it is ill luck for me, who shall probably have
more trouble because he has died at all.</p>

<p>The Duke and Peel announced their resignations in the two
Houses, and Brougham put off his motion, but with a speech
signifying that he should take no part in the new Government.
The last acts of the Duke were to secure pensions of
250&#8467;. a year to each of his secretaries, and to fill up the ecclesiastical
preferments. The Garter remains for his successor.
The Duke of Bedford got it, and, what is singular,
the Duke of Wellington would probably have given it him
likewise. He was one of five whom he meant to choose from,
and it lay between him and Lord Cleveland.</p>

<p>I met the Duke coming out of his room, but did not
like to speak to him; he got into his cabriolet, and nodded
as he passed, but he looked very grave. The King seems to
have behaved perfectly throughout the whole business, no
intriguing or underhand communication with anybody, with
great kindness to his Ministers, anxious to support them
while it was possible, and submitting at once to the necessity
of parting with them. The fact is he turns out an incomparable
King, and deserves all the encomiums that are
lavished on him. All the mountebankery which signalised
his conduct when he came to the throne has passed away
with the excitement which caused it, and he is as dignified
as the homeliness and simplicity of his character will allow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
him to be. I understand he sent for Lord Spencer in the
course of the day, who probably said he could not undertake
anything, for he afterwards sent for Lord Grey (after the
House of Lords), and as he must have been very well prepared,
it is probable that a new Government will be speedily
formed.</p>

<p>I went to Lady Jersey&rsquo;s in the evening, when she was or
affected to be very gay and very glad that the Duke was out.
I found there the Prince of Orange, Esterhazy, Madame de
Dino, Wilton, Worcester, Duncannon, Lord Rosslyn, Matuscewitz,
&amp;c. There has been a strong idea that the Chancellor
[Lyndhurst] would keep the seals. Both Holmes and
Planta have repeatedly told the Duke that he would be
beaten in the House of Commons, and they both knew the
House thoroughly. Still he never would do anything. He
made overtures to Palmerston just before Parliament met
through Lord Clive, and the result was an interview between
them at Apsley House, but it came to nothing. I dare say
he did not offer half enough. It is universally believed that
Peel pressed the Civil List question for the purpose of being
beaten upon it, and going out on that rather than on Reform,
for Planta told him how it would be, and he might very well
have given the Committee if he had liked it; but he said he
would abide by it, and he certainly was in excellent spirits
afterwards for a beaten Minister. Now that this Reform has
served their purpose so well, and turned out the Duke, the
Opposition would be well satisfied to put it aside again, and
take time to consider what they shall do, for it is a terrible
question for them. Pledged as they have been, it is sure to
be the rock on which the little popularity they have gained
will split, as it is a hundred to one that whatever they do
they will not go far enough to satisfy the country.</p>

<h3>November 19th, 1830</h3>

<p>The day before yesterday Lord Grey
went to the King, who received him with every possible
kindness, and gave him <i>carte blanche</i> to form a new Administration,
placing even the Household at his disposal&mdash;much
to the disgust of the members of it. Ever since the town
has been as usual teeming with reports, but with fewer lies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISCONTENT OF BROUGHAM.</span>
than usual. The fact is Lord Grey has had no difficulties,
and has formed a Government at once; only Brougham put
them all in a dreadful fright. He all but declared a hostile
intention to the future Administration; he boasted that he
would take nothing, refuse even the Great Seal, and nourished
his Reform <i>in terrorem</i> over their heads; he was affronted and
furious because he fancied they neglected him, but it all
arose, as I am told, from Lord Grey&rsquo;s letter to him not
reaching him directly, by some mistake, for that he was the
first person he wrote to. Still it is pretty clear that this
eccentric luminary will play the devil with their system.</p>

<p>[The letter could not be the cause. The history of the
transaction is this:&mdash;When Lord Grey undertook to form a
Government he sent for Lord Lansdowne and Lord Holland,
and these three began to work, without consulting with
Brougham or any member of the House of Commons.
Brougham was displeased at not being consulted at first,
but was indignant when Lord Grey proposed to him to
be Attorney-General. Then he showed his teeth, and they
grew frightened, and soon after they sent Sefton to him, who
got him into good humour, and it was made up by the offer
of the Great Seal.&mdash;<i>November 23rd</i>.]</p>

<h3>November 20th, 1830</h3>

<p>Here I was interrupted, and broke off
yesterday morning. At twelve o&rsquo;clock yesterday everything
was settled but the Great Seal, and in the afternoon the
great news transpired that Brougham had accepted it.
Great was the surprise, greater still the joy at a charm
having been found potent enough to lay the unquiet spirit, a
bait rich enough to tempt his restless ambition. I confess
I had no idea he would have accepted the Chancellorship
after his declarations in the House of Commons and the
whole tenor of his conduct. I was persuaded that he had
made to himself a political existence the like of which no man
had ever before possessed, and that to have refused the
Great Seal would have appeared more glorious than to take
it; intoxicated with his Yorkshire honours, swollen with his
own importance, and holding in his hands questions which
he could employ to thwart, embarrass, and ruin any Ministry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
I thought that he meant to domineer in the House
of Commons and to gather popularity throughout the
country by enforcing popular measures of which he would
have all the credit, and thus establish a sort of individual
power and authority, which would ensure his being dreaded,
courted, and consulted by all parties. He could then have
gratified his vanity, ambition, and turbulence; the Bar would
have supplied fortune, and events would have supplied enjoyments
suited to his temperament; it would have been a
sort of madness, mischievous but splendid. As it is the
joy is great and universal; all men feel that he is emasculated
and drops on the Woolsack as on his political death-bed;
once in the House of Lords, there is an end of him,
and he may rant storm and thunder without hurting
anybody.<a name="FNA_12_18" id="FNA_12_18"></a><a href="#FN_12_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The other places present a plausible show, but are not
well distributed, some ill filled. Graham Admiralty, Melbourne
Home, Auckland Board of Trade&mdash;all bad. The

ignorant.<a name="FNA_12_19" id="FNA_12_19"></a><a href="#FN_12_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
They have done it very quickly, however, and
without many difficulties. As to the Duke of Richmond,

<span class="pagehead">LORD GREY&rsquo;S ADMINISTRATION.</span>
people are indignant at a half-pay lieutenant-colonel
commanding the Ordnance Department, and as an acquisition
he is of doubtful value, for it seems the Tories will not
go with him, at least will not consider themselves as his
followers; so said Lord Mansfield and Vyvyan.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_19" id="FN_12_19"></a><a href="#FNA_12_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a>
[This is a remarkable instance of the manner in which the prognostications
of the most acute observers are falsified by events. The value of
Mr. Greville&rsquo;s remarks on the men of his time consists not in their absolute
truth, but in their sincerity at the moment at which they were made.
They convey a correct impression of the notion prevailing at that time.
Thus Sir James Graham became unquestionably a very active First Lord of
the Admiralty, Lord Melbourne a &lsquo;considerable&rsquo; Prime Minister of England,
and Lord Auckland a painstaking and well-informed Governor-General
of India.]</p></div>

<h3>November 21st, 1830</h3>

<p>The Duke of Richmond&rsquo;s appointment
was found so unpalatable to the army that they have been
forced to change it, and he is to be Master of the Horse
instead, which I suspect will not be to his taste. [He afterwards
refused the Mastership of the Horse, and it ended in
his being Postmaster-General, but without taking the salary.]</p>

<p>There have been some little changes, but no great difficulties.
It was at first said that there would be no Opposition,
and that Peel would not stir; but William Peel told
me last night that the old Ministerial party was by no
means so tranquilly inclined. Peel will not be violent or
factious, but he thinks an attentive Opposition desirable, and
he will not desert those who have looked up to and supported
him. Then there will be the Tories (who will to
a certainty end by joining him and his party) and the
Radicals&mdash;three distinct parties, and enough to keep the
Government on the <i>qui vive</i>. The expulsion of the late
Government from power will satisfy the vengeance of the
Tories, and I have no doubt they will now make it up.
Peel will be the leader of a party to which all the Conservative
interest of the country will repair; and it is my
firm belief that in a very short time (two or three years, or
less) he will be Prime Minister, and will hold power
long.<a name="FNA_12_20" id="FNA_12_20"></a><a href="#FN_12_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
The Duke will probably never take office again, but will be
at the head of the army, and his own friends begin to admit
that this would be the most desirable post for him. Lord
Lyndhurst will be greatly disgusted at Brougham&rsquo;s taking
the Great Seal. I met him the day before yesterday, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
he had no idea of it; he thought it would certainly be put
in Commission, and evidently looked forward to filling the
office again in a few months. He said that he had long
foreseen this catastrophe, and it was far better to be out
than to drag on as they did; that he had over and over
again said to the Duke, and remonstrated with him on the
impossibility of carrying on such a Government, but that he
would never listen to anything. Sir John Leach, too, was
exceedingly disappointed; he told me he had not heard a
word of what was going on, that he was contented where he
was, &lsquo;though perhaps he might have been miserable <i>in
another situation</i>.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_12_21" id="FNA_12_21"></a><a href="#FN_12_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_20" id="FN_12_20"></a><a href="#FNA_12_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a>
[This prediction was not fulfilled until 1841 (for the short Administration
of Sir Robert in 1834 can hardly be reckoned), but it <i>was</i> fulfilled
at last.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_21" id="FN_12_21"></a><a href="#FNA_12_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a>
[Lord Grey certainly contemplated at one moment the offer of the
Great Seal to Lord Lyndhurst, but the spectre of Brougham rendered that
impossible. Brougham himself would have preferred the advancement of
Sir John Leach to the Woolsack, which would have left the Rolls at his
own disposal, and enabled him to retain his seat in the House of Commons.
But this suggestion was by no means welcome to Lord Grey, and Lord
Althorp at once declared that he could not undertake the leadership of the
House of Commons if Brougham was to remain in it in any official position
to domineer over him.]</p></div>

<p>In the meantime the new Government will find plenty
to occupy their most serious thoughts and employ their best
talents. The state of the country is dreadful; every post
brings fresh accounts of conflagrations, destruction of
machinery, association of labourers, and compulsory rise of
wages. Cobbett and Carlile write and harangue to inflame
the minds of the people, who are already set in motion
and excited by all the events which have happened abroad.
Distress is certainly not the cause of these commotions,
for the people have patiently supported far greater privations
than they had been exposed to before these riots, and the
country was generally in an improving state.</p>

<p>The Duke of Richmond went down to Sussex and had
a battle with a mob of 200 labourers, whom he beat with
fifty of his own farmers and tenants, harangued them, and
sent them away in good humour. He is, however, very popular.
In Hants the disturbances have been dreadful. There
was an assemblage of 1,000 or 1,500 men, a part of whom
went towards Baring&rsquo;s house (the Grange) after destroying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BROUGHAM LORD CHANCELLOR.</span>
threshing-machines and other agricultural implements; they
were met by Bingham Baring, who attempted to address
them, when a fellow (who had been employed at a guinea
a week by his father up to four days before) knocked him
down with an iron bar and nearly killed him. They have
no troops in that part of the country, and there is a depôt
of arms at Winchester.</p>

<p>The Prince of Orange, who has been fancying without the
least reason that he should be recalled to Belgium, is now
in despair; and the Provisional Government, on hearing of
the change of Ministry here, have suspended their negotiations,
thinking they shall get from Lord Grey a more
extended frontier. Altogether the alarm which prevails is
very great, and those even are terrified who never were so
before.</p>

<h3>November 22nd, 1830</h3>

<p>Dined yesterday at Sefton&rsquo;s; nobody
there but Lord Grey and his family, Brougham and Montrond,
the latter just come from Paris. It was excessively agreeable.
Lord Grey in excellent spirits, and Brougham, whom Sefton
bantered from the beginning to the end of
dinner.<a name="FNA_12_22" id="FNA_12_22"></a><a href="#FN_12_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
Be Brougham&rsquo;s political errors what they may, his gaiety,
temper, and admirable social qualities make him delightful,
to say nothing of his more solid merits, of liberality,
generosity, and charity; for charity it is to have taken the
whole family of one of his brothers who is dead&mdash;nine
children&mdash;and maintained and educated them. From this
digression to return to our dinner: it was uncommonly
gay. Lord Grey said he had taken a task on himself which
he was not equal to, prided himself on having made his
arrangements so rapidly, and on having named no person to
any office who was not efficient; he praised Lyndhurst
highly, said he liked him, that his last speech was luminous,
and that he should like very much to do anything he could
for him, but that it was such an object to have Brougham
on the Woolsack. So I suppose he would not dislike to take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
in Lyndhurst by-and-by. He would not tell us whom he
has got for the Ordnance. John Russell was to have had
the War Office, but
Tavistock<a name="FNA_12_23" id="FNA_12_23"></a><a href="#FN_12_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
entreated that the appointment
might be changed, as his brother&rsquo;s health was unequal
to it; so he was made Paymaster. Lord Grey said he had
more trouble with those offices than with the Cabinet ones.
Sefton did nothing but quiz Brougham&mdash;&lsquo;My Lord&rsquo; every
minute, and &lsquo;What does his Lordship say?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure it is
very condescending of his Lordship to speak to such <i>canaille</i>
as all of you,&rsquo; and a thousand jokes. After dinner he walked
out before him with the fire shovel for the mace, and left him
no repose all the evening. I wish Leach could have heard
Brougham. He threatened to sit often at the Cockpit, in
order to check
Leach,<a name="FNA_12_24" id="FNA_12_24"></a><a href="#FN_12_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
who, though a good judge in his own
Court, was good for nothing in a Court of Appeal; he said
that Leach&rsquo;s being Chancellor was impossible, as there were
forty-two appeals from him to the Chancellor, which he
would have had to decide himself; and that he (Brougham)
had wanted the Seal to be put in Commission with three
judges, which would have been the best reform of the Court,
expedited business, and satisfied suitors; but that Lord
Grey would not hear of it, and had forced him to take it,
which he was averse to do, being reluctant to leave the
House of Commons.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_22" id="FN_12_22"></a><a href="#FNA_12_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a>
[Lord Brougham had taken his seat on the Woolsack as Lord High
Chancellor on the afternoon of this day, the 22nd of November. The patent
of his peerage bore the same date.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_23" id="FN_12_23"></a><a href="#FNA_12_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a>
[The Marquis of Tavistock, Lord John Russell&rsquo;s eldest brother, afterwards
Duke of Bedford. Lord John has since held almost every Cabinet
office: his brother&rsquo;s notion that his health was unequal to the War Office
in 1830 is amusing.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_12_24" id="FN_12_24"></a><a href="#FNA_12_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a>
[The Master of the Rolls was at that time the presiding Judge of
Appeal at the Privy Council, which was commonly spoken of as &lsquo;the Cockpit,&rsquo;
because it sat on the site of the old Cockpit at Whitehall; but the business
was very ill done, which led Lord Brougham to bring in and carry his Act
for the creation of the Judicial Committee in 1832&mdash;one of his best and most
successful measures.]</p></div>

<p>He said the Duke of Richmond had done admirably in
capturing the incendiary who has been taken, and who they
think will afford a clue whereby they will discover the secret
of all the burnings. This man called himself Evans. They
had information of his exciting the peasantry, and sent a
Bow Street officer after him. He found out where he lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">COUNCIL OF THE NEW MINISTERS.</span>
and captured him (having been informed that he was not
there by the inmates of the house), and took him to the Duke,
who had him searched. On his person were found stock
receipts for 800&#8467;., of which 50&#8467;. was left; and a chemical
receipt in a secret pocket for combustibles. He was taken
to prison, and will be brought up to town. Montrond was
very amusing&mdash;&lsquo;You, Lord Brougham, when you mount
your bag of wool?&rsquo;</p>

<h3>November 23rd, 1830</h3>

<p>Yesterday at Court; a great day, and
very amusing. The old Ministers came to give up their seals,
and the new Ministers came to take them. All the first were
assembled at half-past one; saw the King in his closet severally,
and held their last Council to swear in George Dawson
a Privy Councillor. Each after his audience departed, most
of them never to return. As they went away they met the
others arriving. I was with the old set in the Throne Room
till they went away, and on opening the door and looking
into the other room I found it full of the others&mdash;Althorp,
Graham, Auckland, J. Russell, Durham, &amp;c., faces that a
little while ago I should have had small expectation of finding
there. The effect was very droll, such a complete <i>changement
de décoration</i>. When the old Ministers were all off the business
of the day began. All the Cabinet was there&mdash;the new
Master of the Horse (Lord Albemarle), Lord Wellesley, his
little eyes twinkling with joy, and Brougham, in Chancellor&rsquo;s
costume, but not yet a Peer. The King sent for me into the
closet to settle about their being sworn in, and to ask what
was to be done about Brougham, whose patent was not come,
and who wanted to go to the House of Lords. These things
settled, he held the Council, when twelve new Privy Councillors
were sworn in, three Secretaries of State, Privy Seal, and
the declarations made of President of Council and Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland. The King could not let slip the opportunity
of making a speech, so when I put into his hands
the paper declaring Lord Anglesey Lord-Lieutenant he was not
content to read it, but spoke nearly as follows:&mdash;&lsquo;My Lords,
it is a part of the duty I have to perform to declare a Lord-Lieutenant
of Ireland, and although I certainly should have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
acquiesced in any recommendation which might have been
made to me for this appointment by Earl Grey, I must say
that I have peculiar satisfaction in entrusting that most
important charge to the noble Lord, whom I therefore
declare with entire satisfaction Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland.
And, my Lords, I must say that this day is since that of the
death of my poor brother (here his voice faltered and he
looked or tried to look affected) the most important which
has occurred since the beginning of my reign, for in the
course of my long life it has never happened to me to see so
many appointments to be filled up as on this day; and when
I consider that it is only last Tuesday night that the force of
circumstances compelled those who were the confidential
advisers of the Crown to relinquish the situations which they
held, and that in this short space of time a new Government
has been formed, I cannot help considering such despatch as
holding forth the best hopes for the future, and proving the
unanimity of my Government; and, my Lords, I will take this
opportunity of saying that the noble Earl (Grey) and the
other noble Lords and gentlemen may be assured that they
will receive from me the most cordial, unceasing, and devoted
support.&rsquo; The expressions of course are not exactly the
same, but his speech was to this purpose, only longer.
Brougham kissed hands in the closet, and afterwards in
Council as Chancellor and Privy Councillor, and then went
off to the House of Lords.</p>

<h3>November 25th, 1830</h3>

<p>The accounts from the country on the
23rd were so bad that a Cabinet sat all the morning, and concerted
a proclamation offering large rewards for the discovery
of offenders, rioters, or burners. Half the Cabinet walked to
St. James&rsquo;s, where I went with the draft proclamation
in my pocket, and we held a Council in the King&rsquo;s room to
approve it. I remember the last Council of this sort we held
was on Queen Caroline&rsquo;s business. She had demanded to be
heard by counsel in support of her asserted right to be
crowned, and the King ordered in Council that she should be
heard. We held the Council in his dressing-room at Carlton
House; he was in his bedgown, and we in our boots. This
proclamation did not receive the sign manual or the Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Seal and was not engrossed till the next day, but was nevertheless
published in the &lsquo;Gazette.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Yesterday the accounts were better. There was a levee
and Council, all the Ministers present but Palmerston and
Holland. The King made a discourse, and took occasion
(about some Admiralty order) to introduce the whole history
of his early naval life, his first going to sea and the instructions
which George III. gave Admiral Digby as to his treatment.
All the old Ministers came to the levee except the
Duke of Wellington, who was in Hampshire to try his influence
as Lord-Lieutenant in putting down the riots. Anson as
Master of the Buckhounds was made a Privy Councillor, not
usually a Privy Councillor&rsquo;s place, but the King said he
rather liked increasing the number than not. Clanricarde
has a Gold Stick, so there is Canning&rsquo;s son-in-law in office
under Lord Grey! There has been a difficulty about the
Master-General of the Ordnance, and a little difference
between Lord Grey and Lord Hill: when the Duke of Richmond
was withdrawn, Grey determined to appoint Sir W.
Gordon, but as Gordon would have to give up a permanent
for a temporary office, he bargained that he should have the
Grand Cross of the Bath. Lord Grey at the same time
promised his brother Sir Charles Grey a Grand Cross,
but Lord Hill (who as Commander-in-Chief has all the
Crosses at his disposal) was offended at what he considered a
slight to him and went to the King to complain. It is
probable that Lord Grey knew nothing of the matter, and
fancied they were all recommended by himself. As the
matter stands now, Gordon&rsquo;s appointment is suspended.
The only other difficulty is to find a Secretary at War.
Sandon is to have it, if they can make no better arrangement.
I had a long conversation with the Duke of Richmond
yesterday about refusing the salary of his office, and
entreated him to take it, for most people think his declining
it great nonsense. He alleged a great many bad reasons for
declining, but promised to consider the matter.</p>

<p>I am in a very disagreeable situation as regards my late
colleague&rsquo;s place. Lord Bathurst wrote a letter to Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISTURBED STATE OF THE COUNTRY.</span>
Lansdowne stating that the King had approved of his son&rsquo;s
appointment, and that he had intended to reduce the salary
of the office. Lord Grey spoke to the King, and said that
after what had passed in both Houses he did not wish to do
anything, but to leave the office to be dealt with by a Committee
of the House of Commons, under whose consideration
it would come. Lord Lansdowne said he certainly should do
nothing either, so that it remains to be seen whether they
will give me a colleague, a deputy, or nothing at all.</p>

<h3>November 28th, 1830</h3>

<p>The Duke of Wellington, who as soon
as he was out of office repaired to Hants, and exerted himself
as Lord-Lieutenant to suppress the disorders, returned yesterday,
having done much good, and communicated largely
with the Secretary of State. The Government are full of
compliments and respects to him, and the Chancellor wrote
him a letter entreating he would name any gentleman to be
added to the Special Commission which was going down to
the county over which he &lsquo;so happily presided.&rsquo; He named
three.</p>

<p>There has been nothing new within these three days, but
the alarm is still very great, and the general agitation which
pervades men&rsquo;s minds unlike what I have ever seen. Reform,
economy, echoed backwards and forwards, the doubts, the
hopes and the fears of those who have anything to lose, the
uncertainty of everybody&rsquo;s future condition, the immense
interests at stake, the magnitude and imminence of the
danger, all contribute to produce a nervous excitement, which
extends to all classes&mdash;to almost every individual. Until the
Ministers are re-elected nobody can tell what will be done in
Parliament, and Lord Grey himself has no idea what sort of
strength the Government will have in either House; but there
is a prevailing opinion that they ought to be supported at
this moment, although the Duke of Wellington and Peel
mean to keep their party together. Lyndhurst&rsquo;s resignation
with his colleagues (added to his not being invited to join
this Government) has restored him to the good graces of his
party, for Lord Bathurst told me had behaved very
honourably. He means now to set to work to gain character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and as he is about the ablest public man going, and nearly
the best speaker, he will yet bustle himself into consideration
and play a part once more. Peel, Lyndhurst, and Hardinge
are three capital men for the foundation of a party&mdash;as
men of business superior to any three in this Cabinet. But
I doubt if the Duke will ever be in a civil office again, nor do
I think the country would like to see him at the head of a
Government, unless it was one conducted in a very different
manner from the last. For the present deplorable state of
things, and for the effervescence of public opinion, which
threatens the overthrow of the constitution in trying to
amend it, Peel and the Duke are entirely responsible; and
the former is the less excusable because he might have
known better, and if he had gone long ago to the Duke, and
laid before him the state of public opinion, told him how irresistible
it was, and had refused to carry on the Government
in the House of Commons with such a crew as he had,
the Duke must have given way. Notwithstanding the great
measures which have distinguished his Government, such as
Catholic Emancipation, and the repeal of the Test Acts, a
continual series of systematic blunders, an utter ignorance of,
and indifference to, public opinion, have rendered the first
of these great measures almost useless. Ireland is on the
point of becoming in a worse state than before the Catholic
question was settled; and why? Because, first of all, the settlement
was put off too long, and the fever of agitation would
not subside, and because it was accompanied by an insult to
O&rsquo;Connell, which he has been resolved to revenge, and which
he knows he can punish. Then instead of depriving him of
half his influence by paying the priests, and so getting them
under the influence of Government, they neglected this, and
followed up the omission by taxing Ireland, and thus uniting
the whole nation against us. What is this but egregious
presumption, blindness, ignorance, and want of all political
calculation and foresight? What remains now to be done?
Perhaps nothing, for the anti-Union question is spreading far
and wide with a velocity that is irresistible, and it is the
more dangerous because the desire for the repeal of the Union
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE RESULTS OF TORY GOVERNMENT.</span>
is rather the offspring of imagination than of reason, and
arises from vague, excited hopes, not, like the former agitation,
from real wrongs, long and deeply felt. But common shifts
and expedients, partial measures, will not do now, and in the
state of the game a deep stake must be played or all will
be lost. To buy O&rsquo;Connell at any price, pay the Catholic
Church, establish poor laws, encourage emigration, and
repeal the obnoxious taxes and obnoxious laws, are the only
expedients which have a chance of restoring order. It is
easy to write these things, but perhaps difficult to carry them
into execution, but what we want is a head to conceive and a
heart to execute such measures as the enormous difficulties of
the times demand.</p>

<h3>December 1st, 1830</h3>

<p>The last two or three days have produced
no remarkable outrages, and though the state of the country
is still dreadful, it is rather better on the whole than it was;
but London is like the capital of a country desolated by cruel
war or foreign invasion, and we are always looking for
reports of battles, burnings, and other disorders. Wherever
there has been anything like fighting, the mob has always
been beaten, and has shown the greatest cowardice. They
do not, however, seem to have been actuated by a very ferocious
spirit; and considering the disorders of the times, it
is remarkable that they have not been more violent and
rapacious. Lord Craven, who is just of age, with three or four
more young Lords, his friends, defeated and dispersed them in
Hampshire. They broke into the Duke of Beaufort&rsquo;s house
at Heythrop, but he and his sons got them out without
mischief, and afterwards took some of them. On Monday as
the field which had been out with the King&rsquo;s hounds were
returning to town, they were summoned to assist in quelling
a riot at Woburn, which they did; the gentlemen
charged and broke the people, and took some of them, and
fortunately some troops came up to secure the prisoners.
The alarm, however, still continues, and a feverish anxiety
about the future universally prevails, for no man can foresee
what course events will take, nor how his own individual circumstances
may be affected by them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
The Government in the meantime promises fair, and they
begin by a display of activity, in early attendance at their
offices, and unusual recommendation of diligence and
economy. But Lord Grey&rsquo;s Government is already carped
at, and not without apparent reason. The distribution of
offices is in many instances bad; many of the appointments
were bad, and the number of his own family provided for is
severely criticised. There are of Lord Grey&rsquo;s family: Howick,
Under-Secretary; Ellice, Secretary of the Treasury; Barrington,
Lord of the Admiralty; Durham, Privy Seal; Wood,
Private Secretary (though he has no salary); and Lambton&rsquo;s
brother in the Household. Melbourne at the Home Office is
considered an inefficient successor to Peel, Graham too young
and not enough distinguished for the Admiralty; Poulett
Thomson is said to entertain the most Radical opinions;
Althorp put him in. There never was a more sudden rise
than this; a young merchant, after two or three years of
Parliament and two or three speeches, is made Vice-President
of the Board of Trade, Treasurer of the Navy, and a Privy
Councillor. Then Althorp as Chancellor of the Exchequer
may be a good one, but nobody expects much from anything
that is already known about him. This constitution of the
Government has already done harm, and has stamped a
character of rapacity upon Lord Grey, which he will hear of
in proper time; but at this moment he has got all the press
on his side, and people are resolved to give him credit for
good intentions. Brougham has captivated the Archbishop
of Canterbury by offering to give livings to any deserving
clergyman he would recommend to him. I met him at
dinner yesterday in the greatest spirits, elated and not
altered by his new dignity. He is full of projects of reform
in the administration of justice, and talks of remodelling
the Privy Council as a Court of Appeal, which would be of
great use.</p>

<p>The Liverpool election, which is just over, was, considering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum">LIVERPOOL ELECTION</span>
the present state of things, a remarkable contest. It
is said to have cost near 100,000&#8467;. to the two parties, and to
have exhibited a scene of bribery and corruption perfectly
unparalleled; no concealment or even semblance of decency
was observed; the price of tallies and of votes rose, like
stock, as the demand increased, and single votes fetched from
15&#8467;. to 100&#8467;. apiece. They voted by tallies; as each tally
voted for one or the other candidate they were furnished
with a receipt for their votes, with which they went to the
committee, when through a hole in the wall the receipt was
handed in, and through another the stipulated sum handed
out; and this scene of iniquity has been exhibited at a period
when the cry for Reform is echoed from one end of the
country to the other, and in the case of a man (Denison)
who stood on the principle of Reform. Nobody yet knows
whence the money for Denison comes (the Ewarts are enormously
rich), but it will be still more remarkable if he should
pay it himself, when he is poor, careful of money, and was
going to India the other day in order to save 12,000&#8467;. or
15,000&#8467;. If anybody had gone down at the eleventh hour
and polled one good vote, he would have beaten both candidates
and disfranchised the borough. As it is, it is probable
the matter will be taken up and the borough disfranchised.
The right of voting is as bad as possible in the freemen, who
are the lowest rabble of the town and, as it appears, a parcel
of venal wretches. Here comes the difficulty of Reform, for
how is it possible to reform the electors?</p>

<h3>December 5th, 1830</h3>

<p>The country is getting quieter, but though
the immediate panic is passing away men&rsquo;s minds are not
the less disquieted as to our future prospects. Not a soul
knows what plan of Reform the Ministers will propose, nor
how far they are disposed to go. The Duke of Devonshire
has begun in his own person by announcing to the Knaresborough
people that he will never again interfere with that
borough. Then the Black Book, as it is called, in which all
places and pensions are exhibited, has struck terror into all
who are named and virtuous indignation into all who are
not. Nothing can be more <i>mal à propos</i> than the appearance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
of this book at such a season, when there is such discontent
about our institutions and such unceasing endeavours
to bring them into contempt. The history of the book
is this:&mdash;Graham moved last year for a return of all Privy
Councillors who had more than 1,000&#8467;. a year, and Goulburn
chose to give him a return of <i>all persons</i> who had more than
1,000&#8467;. a year, because he thought the former return would
be invidious to Privy Councillors; so he caused that to be
published, which will remove no obloquy from those he meant
to save, but draw down a great deal on hundreds of others,
and on the Government under which such things exist. I
speak feelingly, for &lsquo;quorum pars magna sum.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington gave a great dinner yesterday
to all the people who had gone out of office (about fifty), so
that it is clear they mean to keep together. Whether he
looks forward to be Prime Minister again it is impossible to
say, but his real friends would prefer his taking the command
of the army, whatever his fools and flatterers may do. Lord
Lyndhurst, who loses everything by the fall of the late
Government, cannot get over it, particularly as he feels that
the Duke&rsquo;s obstinacy brought it about, and that by timely
concessions and good management he might have had Lord
Grey, Palmerston, and all that are worth having. Peel, on
the contrary, is delighted; he wants leisure, is glad to get
out of such a firm, and will have time to form his own plans
and avail himself of circumstances, which, according to every
probability, must turn out in his favour. His youth (for a
public man), experience, and real capacity for business will
inevitably make him Minister hereafter. The Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s
fall,<a name="FNA_13_02" id="FNA_13_02"></a><a href="#FN_13_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
if the causes of it are dispassionately
traced and considered, affords a great political lesson. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POLITICAL CHARACTER OF WELLINGTON.</span>
is one of those mixed characters which it is difficult to praise
or blame without the risk of doing them more or less than
justice. He has talents which the event has proved to be
sufficient to make him the second (and, now that Napoleon
is gone, the first general) of the age, but which could not
make him a tolerable Minister. Confident, presumptuous,
and dictatorial, but frank, open, and good-humoured, he
contrived to rule in the Cabinet without mortifying his
colleagues, and he has brought it to ruin without forfeiting
their regard. Choosing with a very slender stock of knowledge
to take upon himself the sole direction of every department
of Government, he completely sank under the burden.
Originally imbued with the principles of Lord Castlereagh
and the Holy Alliance, he brought all those predilections
with him into office. Incapable of foreseeing the mighty
events with which the future was big, and of comprehending
the prodigious alterations which the moral character of
Europe had undergone, he pitted himself against Canning in
the Cabinet, and stood up as the assertor of maxims both of
foreign and domestic policy which that great statesman saw
were no longer fitted for the times we live in. With a
flexibility which was more remarkably exhibited at subsequent
periods, when he found that the cause he advocated
was lost, the Duke turned suddenly round, and surrendered
his opinions at discretion; but in his heart he never forgave
Mr. Canning, and from that time jealousy of him had a
material influence on his political conduct, and was the
primary motive of many of his subsequent resolutions. This
flexibility has been the cause of great benefits to the country,
but ultimately of his own downfall, for it has always proceeded
from the pressure of circumstances and considerations
of convenience to himself, and not from a rational adaptation
of his opinions and conduct to the necessities and variations
of the times. He has not been thoroughly true to any principle
or any party; he contrived to disgust and alienate his
old friends and adherents without conciliating or attaching
those whose measures he at the eleventh hour undertook to
carry into execution. Through the whole course of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
political conduct selfish considerations have never been out
of sight. His opposition to Canning&rsquo;s Corn Bill was too
gross to admit of excuse. It was the old spite bursting forth,
sharpened by Canning&rsquo;s behaviour to him in forming his
Administration, which, if it was not contumelious, certainly
was not courteous. When at his death the Duke assumed
the Government, his disclaiming speech was thrown in his
teeth, but without much justice, for such expressions are
never to be taken literally, and in the subsequent quarrel
with Huskisson, though it is probably true that he was
aiming at domination, he was persuaded that Huskisson and
his party were endeavouring to form a cabal in the Cabinet,
and his expulsion of them is not, therefore, altogether without
excuse. On the question of the Test Act it was evident he
was guided by no principle, probably by no opinion, and that
he only thought of turning it as best he might to his own
advantage. Throughout the Catholic question self was
always apparent, not that he was careless of the safety, or
indifferent to the prosperity of the country, but that he cared
as much for his own credit and power, and never considered
the first except in their connection with the second. The
business of Emancipation he certainly conducted with considerable
judgment, boldly trusting to the baseness of many
of his old friends, and showing that he had not mistaken
their characters; exercising that habitual influence he had acquired
over the mind of the King; preserving impenetrable
secresy; using without scruple every artifice that could
forward his object; and contriving to make tools or dupes of
all his colleagues and adherents, and getting the whole merit
to himself. From the passing of the Catholic question his
conduct has exhibited a series of blunders which have at
length terminated in his fall. The position in which he then
stood was this:&mdash;He had a Government composed of men
who were for the most part incompetent, but perfectly subservient
to him. He had a considerable body of adherents
in both Houses. The Whigs, whose support (enthusiastically
given) had carried him triumphantly through the great contest,
were willing to unite with him; the Tories, exasperated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POLITICAL CHARACTER OF WELLINGTON.</span>
and indignant, feeling insulted and betrayed, vowed nothing
but vengeance. Intoxicated with his victory, he was resolved
to neglect the Whigs, to whom he was so much indebted,
and to regain the affections of the Tories, whom he considered
as his natural supporters, and whom he thought
identity of opinion and interest would bring back to his
standard. By all sorts of slights and affronting insinuations
that they wanted place, but that he could do without them,
he offended the Whigs, but none of his cajoleries and advances
had the least effect on the sulky Tories. It was in
vain that he endeavoured to adapt his foreign policy to their
worst prejudices by opposing with undeviating hostility that
of Mr. Canning (the great object of their detestation), and
disseminating throughout all Europe the belief of his attachment
to ultra-monarchical principles. He opposed the spirit
of the age, he brought England into contempt, but he did
not conciliate the Tories. Having succeeded in uniting two
powerful parties (acting separately) in opposition to his
Government, and having nobody but Peel to defend his
measures in the House of Commons, and nobody in the
House of Lords, he manifested his sense of his own weakness
by overtures and negotiations, and evinced his obstinate
tenacity of power by never offering terms which could be
accepted, or extending his invitations to those whose authority
he thought might cope with his own. With his Government
falling every day in public opinion, and his enemies growing
more numerous and confident, with questions of vast importance
rising up with a vigour and celerity of growth which
astonished the world, he met a new Parliament (constituted
more unfavourably than the last, which he had found himself
unable to manage) without any support but in his own confidence
and the encouraging adulation of a little knot of
devotees. There still lingered round him some of that
popularity which had once been so great, and which the recollection
of his victories would not suffer to be altogether
extinguished. By a judicious accommodation of his conduct
to that public opinion which was running with an uncontrollable
tide, by a frank invitation to all who were well disposed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to strengthen his Government, he might have raised
those embers of popularity into a flame once more, have saved
himself, and still done good service to the State; but it was
decreed that he should fall. He appeared bereft of all judgment
and discretion, and after a King&rsquo;s Speech which gave
great, and I think unnecessary offence, he delivered the
famous philippic against Reform which sealed his fate.
From that moment it was not doubtful, and he was hurled
from the seat of power amidst universal acclamations.</p>

[The following passage will no doubt be read with surprise, for in
later years Mr. Greville became and remained one of the Duke&rsquo;s most
steady admirers, and as he has himself stated in the memorandum written
nineteen years afterwards, which is inserted at the end of it, the opinion
he entertained of him at this time was unjust. But he at the same time
decided &lsquo;to leave it as it is, because it is of the essence of these Memoirs not
to soften or tone down judgments by the light of altered convictions, but
to leave them standing as contemporary evidence of what was thought at
the time they were written.&rsquo; These are his own words.]</p></div>

<p class="center"><i>[Memorandum added by Mr. Greville in April 1850.</i>]</p>

<blockquote><p>N.B.&mdash;I leave this as it is, though it is unjust to the
Duke of Wellington; but such as my impressions were at
the time they shall remain, to be corrected afterwards when
necessary. It would be very wrong to impute <i>selfishness</i> to
him in the ordinary sense of the term. He coveted power,
but he was perfectly disinterested, a great patriot if ever
there was one, and he was always animated by a strong and
abiding sense of duty. I have done him justice in other
places, and there is after all a great deal of truth in what I
have said here.</p></blockquote>

<h3>December 12th, 1830</h3>

<p>For the last few days the accounts from
the country have been better; there are disturbances in
different parts, and alarms given, but the mischief seems to
be subsiding. The burnings go on, and though they say
that one or two incendiaries have been taken up, nothing
has yet been discovered likely to lead to the detection of the
system. I was at Court on Wednesday, when Kemp and
Foley were sworn in, the first for the Ordnance, the other
Gold Stick (the pensioners). He refused it for a long time,
but at last submitted to what he thought <i>infra dig</i>., because
it was to be sugared with the Lieutenancy of Worcestershire.
There was an Admiralty
report,<a name="FNA_13_03" id="FNA_13_03"></a><a href="#FN_13_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
at which the Chief Justice
was not present. The Chancellor and the Judge (Sir C.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">AN ESCAPE FROM THE GALLOWS.</span>
Robinson) were there for the first time, and not a soul knew
what was the form or what ought to be done; they did,
however, just as in the Recorder&rsquo;s reports. Brougham leans
to mercy, I see. But what a curious sort of supplementary
trial this is; how many accidents may determine the life or
death of the culprit. In one case in this report which they
were discussing (before the Council) Brougham had <i>forgotten</i>
that the man was recommended to mercy, but he told
me that at the last Recorder&rsquo;s report there was a great
difference of opinion on one (a forgery case), when Tenterden
was for hanging the man and he for saving him; that he
had it put to the vote, and the man was saved. Little did
the criminal know when there was a change of Ministry that
he owed his life to it, for if Lyndhurst had been Chancellor
he would most assuredly have been hanged; not that
Lyndhurst was particularly severe or cruel, but he would
have concurred with the Chief Justice and have regarded
the case solely in a judicial point of view, whereas the mind
of the other was probably biassed by some theory about the
crime of forgery or by some fancy of his strange brain.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_13_03" id="FN_13_03"></a><a href="#FNA_13_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[The High Court of Admiralty had still a criminal jurisdiction, and
the capital cases were submitted to the King in Council for approval.]</p></div>

<p>This was a curious case, as I have since heard. The man
owes his life to the curiosity of a woman of fashion, and
then to another feeling. Lady Burghersh and Lady Glengall
wanted to hear St. John Long&rsquo;s trial (the quack who
had <i>man</i>-slaughtered Miss Cashir), and they went to the
Old Bailey for that purpose. Castlereagh and somebody
else, who of course were not up in time, were to have attended
them. They wanted an escort, and the only man in
London sure to be out of bed so early was the Master of the
Rolls, so they went and carried him off. When they got to
the court there was no St. John Long, but they thought
they might as well stay and hear whatever was going on.
It chanced that a man was tried for an atrocious case of
forgery and breach of trust. He was found guilty and
sentence passed; but he was twenty-three and good-looking.
Lady Burghersh could not bear he should be hanged, and
she went to all the late Ministers and the Judges to beg
him off. Leach told her it was no use, that nothing could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
save that man; and accordingly the old Government were
obdurate, when out they went. Off she went again and
attacked all the new ones, who in better humour, or of softer
natures, suffered themselves to be persuaded, and the wretch
was saved. She went herself to Newgate to see him, but
I never heard if she had a private interview, and if he
was afforded an opportunity of expressing his gratitude
with all the fervour that the service she had done him
demanded.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Government is going on what is
called well&mdash;that is, there is a great disposition to give them
a fair trial. All they have done and promise to do about
economy gives satisfaction, and Reform (the awful question)
is still at a distance. There has been, however, some sharp
skirmishing in the course of the week, and there is no want
of bitterness and watchfulness on the part of the old Government.
In the Committee which has been named to enquire
into the salaries of the Parliamentary offices they mean to
leave the question in the hands of the country gentlemen;
but they do not think any great reductions will be practicable,
and as Baring is chairman it is not probable that much
will be done. They think Brougham speaks too often in the
House of Lords, but he has done very well there; and on
Friday he made a reply to Lord Stanhope, which was the
most beautiful piece of sarcasm and complete cutting-up
(though with very good humour) that ever was heard, and
an exhibition to the like of which the Lords have not been
accustomed. The Duke of Wellington made another imprudent
speech, in which (in answer to Lord Radnor, who
attributed the state of the country to the late Government)
he said that it was attributable to the events of July and
August in other countries, and spoke of them in a way
which showed clearly his real opinion and feelings on the
subject.</p>

<p>After some delay Lord Lansdowne made up his mind to
fill up the vacancy in my office, and to give it to William
Bathurst; but he first spoke to the King, who said it was
very true he had told Lord Bathurst that his son should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CLERKS OF THE COUNCIL.</span>
have it, but that he now left the matter entirely to his
decision, showing no anxiety to have William Bathurst
appointed. However, he has it, but reduced to 1,200&#8467;. a
year. I was agreeably surprised yesterday by a communication
from Lord Lansdowne that he thought no alteration
could be made in my emoluments, and that he was quite prepared
to defend them if anybody attacked them. Still,
though it is a very good thing to be so supported, I don&rsquo;t
consider myself safe from Parliamentary assaults. In these
times it will not do to be idle, and I told Lord Lansdowne
that I was anxious to keep my emoluments, but ready to
work for them, and proposed that we Clerks of the Council
should be called upon to act really at the Board of Trade, as
we are, in fact, bound to do; by which means Lack&rsquo;s place
when vacant need not be filled up, and a saving would be
made. My predecessors Cottrell and Fawkener always acted,
their successors Bailer and Chetwynd were incompetent, and
Lack, the Chancellor&rsquo;s Clerk, was made Assistant-Secretary,
and did the work. Huskisson and Hume, his director, made
the business a science; new Presidents and Vice-Presidents
succeeded one another in different Ministerial revolutions;
they and Lack were incompetent, and Hume was made
Assistant-Secretary, and it is he who advises, directs,
legislates. I believe he is one of the ablest practical men
who have ever served, more like an American statesman than
an English official. I am anxious to begin my Trade
education under him.</p>

<p>Parliament is going to adjourn directly for three or four
weeks, to give the Ministers time to make their arrangements
and get rid of the load of business which besets them;
although there is every disposition to give them credit for
good intentions, and to let them have a fair trial, there are
not wanting causes of discontent in many quarters.</p>

<p>All the Russells are dissatisfied that Lord John has not a
seat in the Cabinet, and that Graham should be preferred to
him, and the more so because they know or believe that his
preference is owing to Lambton, who does what he likes with
Lord Grey. My mind has always misgiven me about Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
Grey, and what I have lately heard of him satisfies me that
a more overrated man never lived, or one whose speaking
was so far above his general abilities, or who owed so much
to his oratorical plausibility. His tall, commanding, and
dignified appearance, his flow of language, graceful action,
well rounded periods, and an exhibition of classical taste
united with legal knowledge, render him the most finished
orator of his day; but his conduct has shown him to be
influenced by pride, still more by vanity, personal antipathies,
caprice, indecision, and a thousand weaknesses generated by
these passions and defects. Anybody who is constantly with
him and who can avail themselves of his vanity can govern
him. There was a time when Sir Robert Wilson was his
&lsquo;magnus Apollo&rsquo; (and Codrington), till they quarrelled.
Now Lambton is all in all with him. Lambton dislikes the
Russells, and hence Lord John&rsquo;s exclusion and the preference
of Graham. Everybody remembers how Lord Grey refused
to lead the Whig party when Canning formed his junction
with the Whigs, and declared that he abdicated in favour
of Lord Lansdowne; and then how he came and made
that violent speech against Canning which half killed him
with vexation, and in consequence of which he meant to
have moved into the House of Lords for the express purpose
of attacking Lord Grey. Then when he had quarrelled
with his old Whig friends he began to approach the Tories,
the object of his constant aversion and contempt; and
we knew what civilities passed between the Bathursts and
him, and what political coquetries between him and the
Duke of Wellington, and how he believed that it was only
George IV. who prevented his being invited by the Duke to
join him. Then George IV. dies, King William succeeds;
no invitation to Lord Grey, and he plunges into furious
opposition to the Duke.</p>

<p>About three years ago the Chancellor, Lyndhurst, was the
man in the world he abhorred the most; and it was about
this time that I well recollect one night at Madame de
Lieven&rsquo;s I introduced Lord Grey to Lady Lyndhurst. We
had dined together somewhere, and he had been praising her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD GREY AND LORD LYNDHURST.</span>
beauty; so when we all met there I presented him, and
very soon all his antipathies ceased and he and Lyndhurst
became great friends. This was the cause of Lady Lyndhurst&rsquo;s
partiality for the Whigs, which enraged the Tory
ladies and some of their lords so much, but which served
her turn and enabled her to keep two hot irons in the fire.
When the Duke went out Lord Grey was very anxious to
keep Lyndhurst as his Chancellor, and would have done so
if it had not been for Brougham, who, whirling Reform <i>in
terrorem</i> over his head, announced to him that it must not
be. Reluctantly enough Grey was obliged to give way, for
he saw that with Brougham in the House of Commons,
against him he could not stand for five minutes, and that
the only alternative was to put Brougham on the Woolsack.
Hence his delay in sending for Brougham, the latter&rsquo;s
speech and subsequent acceptance of the Great Seal.
Grey, however, was still anxious to serve Lyndhurst, and
to neutralise his opposition has now proposed to him to
be Chief Baron. This is tempting to a necessitous and
ambitious man. On the other hand he had a good game
before him, if he had played it well, and that was to regain
character, exhibit his great and general powers, and be
ready to avail himself of the course of events; but he has
made his bargain and pocketed his pride. He takes the
judicial office upon an understanding that he is to have no
political connection with the Government (though of course
he will not oppose them), and that he is to be Chief Justice
on Tenterden&rsquo;s death or retirement. This is the secret
article of the treaty, and altogether he has not done amiss;
for there are so few Chancellors in the field that he will
probably (if he chooses) return to the Woolsack in the
event of a change of Government, and he is now in a
position in which he may join either party, and that without
any <i>additional</i> loss of character. The public will gain by
the transaction, because they will get a good judge.</p>

<p>In Ireland the Government have made a change (the
motives of which are not apparent) which will be very unpopular,
and infallibly get them into trouble in various ways.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
They have removed Hart and made Plunket Chancellor.
Hart was very popular with the Bar; he was slow, but had
introduced order and regularity in the proceedings of the
Court. There were no arrears and no appeals. Plunket is
unpopular, and was a bad judge in the Common Pleas, and
will probably make a worse Chancellor; he is rash, hasty,
and imprudent, and it is the more extraordinary as Hart was
affronted by Goderich and went with Anglesey, so upon the
score of confidence (on which they put it) there is in fact not
a pretext for it.</p>

<p>As yet not much can be known of the efficiency of the
rest of the Ministers. The only one who has had anything
to do is Melbourne, and he has surprised all those about him
by a sudden display of activity and vigour, rapid and diligent
transaction of business, for which nobody was prepared, and
which will prove a great mortification to Peel and his friends,
who were in hopes he would do nothing and let the country
be burnt and plundered without interruption. The Duke of
Richmond has plunged neck-deep in politics, and says he is
delighted with it all, and with Lord Grey&rsquo;s candour and unassuming
bearing in the Cabinet. He is evidently piqued that
none of his party have followed him, and made a speech in
the House of Lords the other night expressing his readiness
to defend his having taken office, when nobody attacked him.
Knowing him as I do, and the exact extent of his capacity,
I fancy he must feel rather small by the side of Lord Grey
and Brougham. Graham&rsquo;s elevation is the most monstrous
of all. He was once my friend, a college intimacy revived
in the world, and which lasted six months, when, thinking he
could do better, he cut me, as he had done others before. I
am not a fair judge of him, because the pique which his
conduct to me naturally gave me would induce me to underrate
him, but I take vanity and self-sufficiency to be the prominent
features of his character, though of the extent of his
capacity I will give no opinion. Let time show; I think he
will fail. [Time did show it to be very considerable, and the
<i>volvenda dies</i> brought back our former friendship, as will
hereafter appear; he certainly did <i>not fail</i>.]</p>

He came into Parliament ten years ago, spoke and failed.
He had been a provincial hero, the Cicero and the Romeo of
Yorkshire and Cumberland, a present Lovelace and a future
Pitt. He was disappointed in love (the particulars are of
no consequence), married and retired to digest his mortifications
of various kinds, to become a country gentleman,
patriot, reformer, financier, and what not, always good-looking
(he had been very handsome), pleasing, intelligent,
cultivated, agreeable as a man can be who is not witty and
who is rather pompous and slow, after many years of retirement,
in the course of which he gave to the world his lucubrations
on corn and currency. Time and the hour made
him master of a large but encumbered estate and member
for his county. Armed with the importance of representing
a great constituency, he started again in the House of
Commons; took up Joseph Hume&rsquo;s line, but ornamented it
with graces and flourishes which had not usually decorated
such dry topics. He succeeded, and in that line is now the
best speaker in the House. I have no doubt he has studied
his subjects and practised himself in public speaking. Years
and years ago I remember his delight on Hume&rsquo;s comparison
between Demosthenes and Cicero, and how he knew the
passage by heart; but it is one thing to attack strong abuses
and fire off well-rounded set phrases, another to administer
the naval affairs of the country and be ready to tilt against
all comers, as he must do for the
future.<a name="FNA_13_04" id="FNA_13_04"></a><a href="#FN_13_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Palmerston is said
to have given the greatest satisfaction to the foreign
Ministers, and to have begun very well. So much for the
Ministers.</p>

[This opinion of Sir James Graham is the more curious as he afterwards
became one of Mr. Greville&rsquo;s confidential friends, and rose to the
first rank of oratory and authority in the House of Commons. As Secretary
of State for the Home Department in the great Administration of Sir
Robert Peel he showed administrative ability of the highest order, and he
was, perhaps, the most trusted colleague of that illustrious chief. The
principal failing of Sir James Graham was, in truth, that he was not so
brave and bold a man as he looked.]</p></div>

<h3>December 14th, 1830</h3>

<p>There is a delay in Lyndhurst&rsquo;s appointment,
if it takes place at all.
Alexander<a name="FNA_13_05" id="FNA_13_05"></a><a href="#FN_13_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
now will not resign,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
though he himself proposed to do so in the first instance.
His physician signed a certificate to say that if he went on
this Committee it would cost him his life; some difficulty
about the pension is the cause, or the peerage that he wants.
He is seventy-six and very rich, a wretched judge, and
never knew anything of Common Law. If it is not arranged,
it will be a bad business for Lyndhurst, for the Duke and his
friends are grievously annoyed at his taking the office, having
counted on him as their great champion in the House of
Lords. Mrs. Arbuthnot told me the other night that they
considered themselves released from all obligations to him
for the future. However, they have not at all quarrelled,
and they knew his deplorable state in point of money.
Dined yesterday at Agar Ellis&rsquo;s with eighteen people.
Brougham in great force and very agreeable, and told some
stories of Judge Allan Park, who is a most ridiculous man,
and yet a good lawyer, a good judge, and was a most
eminent counsel.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_13_05" id="FN_13_05"></a><a href="#FNA_13_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[The Chief Baron.]</p></div>

<p>Park is extraordinarily ridiculous. He is a physiognomist,
and is captivated by pleasant looks. In a certain cause, in
which a boy brought an action for defamation against his
schoolmaster, Campbell, his counsel, asked the solicitor if the
boy was good-looking. &lsquo;Very.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, then, have him in court;
we shall get a verdict.&rsquo; And so he did. His eyes are always
wandering about, watching and noticing everything and
everybody. One day there was a dog in court making a
disturbance, on which he said, &lsquo;Take away that dog.&rsquo; The
officers went to remove another dog, when he interposed.
&lsquo;No, not that dog. I have had my eye on that dog the whole
day, and I will say that a better behaved little dog I never
saw in a court of justice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One of Brougham&rsquo;s best speeches was one of his last at
the Bar, made in moving for a new trial on the ground
of misdirection in a great cause (Tatham and Wright)
about a will. He said that on that occasion Park did what
he thought no man&rsquo;s physical powers were equal to; he
spoke in summing up for eleven hours and a half, and
was as fresh at the end as at the beginning; the trial lasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD LYNDHURST AND THE WHIGS.</span>
eight days. This same evening Lord Grosvenor, who is by
way of being a friend to Government, made an <i>amicable</i>
attack upon everything, and talked nonsense. Lord Grey
answered him, and defended his own family appointments in
a very good speech.</p>

<h3>December 15th, 1830</h3>

<p>Dined yesterday with Lord Dudley; sat
next to Lady Lyndhurst, and had a great deal of talk about
politics. She said that the Duke never consulted or communicated
with the Chancellor, who never heard of his overtures to
Palmerston till Madame de Lieven told him; that he had
repeatedly remonstrated with the Duke upon going on in
his weakness, and on one occasion had gone to Walmer on
purpose (leaving her behind that he might talk more freely)
to urge him to take in Lord Grey and some of that party,
but he would not; said he had tried to settle with them, and
it would not do; had tried individuals and had tried the
party. Up to a very late period it appears that Lord Grey
would have joined him, and Lambton came to her repeatedly
to try and arrange something; but this answer of the Duke&rsquo;s
put it out of the question. Then after Lord Grey made his
hostile speech it seems as if the Duke wanted to get him,
for one day Jersey made an appointment with Lady Lyndhurst,
never having called upon her in his life before, came,
and entreated her to try and bring about an accommodation
with Lord Grey, not making use of the Duke&rsquo;s name, but
saying he and Lady Jersey were so unhappy that the Duke
and Lord Grey should not be on good terms, and were so
anxious for the junction; but it was too late then, and the
Lyndhursts themselves had something else to look to. They
both knew very well that Brougham alone prevented his
remaining on the Woolsack, still they have very wisely not
quarrelled with him. After dinner I took Lyndhurst to
Lady Dudley Stuart&rsquo;s, and had some more talk with him. He
thinks, as I do, that this Government does not promise to be
strong. What passed in the House of Commons the other
night exhibited deplorable weakness and the necessity of
depending upon the caprices of hundreds of loose votes,
without anything like a party with which they could venture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
to oppose popular doctrines or measures. He thinks that
Peel must be Minister if there is not a revolution, and that
the Duke&rsquo;s being Prime Minister again is out of the question;
says he <i>knows</i> Peel would never consent to act with him
again in the same capacity, that all the Duke&rsquo;s little cabinet
(the women and the toad-eaters) hate Peel, and that there
never was any real cordiality between them. Everything
confirms my belief that Peel, if he did not bring about the
dissolution of the late Ministry by any overt act, saw to what
things were tending, and saw it with satisfaction.</p>

<h3>December 16th, 1830</h3>

<p>At Court yesterday; William Bathurst
sworn in. All the Ministers were there, and the Duke of Wellington
at the levee looking out of sorts. Dined at the
Lievens&rsquo;; Lady Cowper told me that in the summer the Duke
had not made a <i>direct</i> offer to Melbourne, but what was tantamount
to it. He had desired somebody (she did not say
who) to speak to
Frederick,<a name="FNA_13_06" id="FNA_13_06"></a><a href="#FN_13_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
and said he would call on him
himself the next day. Something, however, prevented him,
and she did not say whether he did call or not afterwards.
He denied ever having made any overture at all. To Palmerston
he proposed the choice of four places, and she thinks
he would have taken in Huskisson if the latter had lived.
He would have done nothing but on compulsion; that is
clear. It is very true (what they say Peel said of him) that
no <i>man</i> ever had any influence with him, only <i>women</i>, and
those always the silliest. But who are Peel&rsquo;s confidants,
friends, and parasites? Bonham, a stock-jobbing ex-merchant;
Charles Ross, and the refuse of society of the House
of Commons.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_13_06" id="FN_13_06"></a><a href="#FNA_13_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
[Sir Frederick Lamb.]</p></div>

<p>Lamb told me afterwards, talking of the Duke and
Polignac, that Sébastiani had told him that Hyde de Neuville
(who was Minister at the time Polignac went over from
here on his first short visit, before he became Minister) said
that upon that occasion Polignac took over a letter from the
Duke to the King of France, in which he said that the Chambers
and the democratical spirit required to be curbed, that
he advised him to lose no time in restraining them, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING AND HIS SONS.</span>
he referred him to M. de Polignac for his opinion generally,
who was in possession of his entire confidence. I think this
<i>may</i> be true, never having doubted that these were his real
sentiments, whether he expressed them or not.</p>

<p>There has been a desperate quarrel between the King and
his sons. George Fitzclarence wanted to be made a Peer
and have a pension; the King said he could not do it, so
they struck work in a body, and George resigned his office
of Deputy Adjutant-General and wrote the King a furious
letter. The King sent for Lord Hill, and told him to try
and bring him to his senses; but Lord Hill could do nothing,
and then he sent for Brougham to talk to him about it. It is
not yet made up, but one of them (Frederick, I believe) dined
at the dinner the King gave the day before yesterday. They
want to renew the days of Charles II., instead of waiting
patiently and letting the King do what he can for them, and
as he can.</p>

<p>The affair at Warsaw seems to have begun with a conspiracy
against Constantine, and four of the generals who
were killed perished in his anteroom in defending him.
With the smallest beginnings, however, nothing is more
probable than a general rising in Poland; and what between
that, Belgians, and Piedmont, which is threatened with a
revolution, the Continent is in a promising state. I agree
with Lamb, who says that such an <i>imbroglio</i> as this cannot
be got right without a war; such a flame can only be quenched
by blood.</p>

<h3>December 19th, 1830</h3>

<p>The week has closed without much
gain to the new Government. On the debate in the House
of Commons about the Evesham election they did not dare
go to a division, as they would certainly have been beaten,
but Peel made a speech which was very good in itself,
and received in a way which proved that he has more consideration
out of office than any of the Ministers, and much
more than he ever had when he was in. Men are looking
more and more to him, and if there is not a revolution he
will assuredly be Prime Minister. The Government is fully
aware how little strength they have, so they have taken a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
new line, and affect to carry on the Government without
Parliamentary influence, and to throw themselves and their
measures upon the impartial judgment of the House. Sefton
informed me the other night that they had resolved not to
take upon themselves the responsibility of proposing any
renewal of the Civil List, but to refer the whole question to
Parliament. I told him that I thought such conduct equally
foolish and unjust, and that it amounted to an abdication of
their Ministerial functions, and a surrender of them into the
hands of the Legislative power; in itself amounting to a
revolution not of dynasty and institutions, but of system of
Government in this country. He is the <i>âme damnée</i> of Lord
Grey, and defends everything of course.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Connell is gone rabid to Ireland, having refused a silk
gown and resolved to pull down Lord Anglesey&rsquo;s popularity.
Shiel writes word that they have resolved <i>not</i> to give Lord
Anglesey a public reception, and to propose an ovation for
O&rsquo;Connell. The law appointments there, made without any
adequate reason, have been ingeniously contrived so as to
disgust every party in Ireland, and to do, or promise to do,
in their ultimate results as much harm as possible. So much
for the only act that the Ministers have yet performed.</p>

<p>I had some conversation with Lyndhurst yesterday, who
thinks the way is already preparing for Peel&rsquo;s return to office,
and that he must be Prime Minister. I told him that I
thought Peel had a fine game to play, but that his own was
just as good, as Peel could do nothing without him in the
other House; to which he replied that they should have no
difficulty, and could make a Government if the Duke of
Wellington did not interpose his claims and aspire again to
be at the head; to which I said that they must not listen to
it, as the country would not bear it; he said he was afraid
the Duke&rsquo;s own set and his women were encouraging him in
such views. Now that it is all over his own Cabinet admit as
freely as anybody his Ministerial despotism. Lyndhurst
partakes of the general alarm at the state of affairs, and of
the astonishment which I and others feel at the apathy of
those who are most interested in averting the impending
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BISHOP OF EXETER AND LORD MELBOURNE.</span>
danger. Yesterday Mr. Stapleton (Canning&rsquo;s late private
secretary) called on me to discuss this subject, and the propriety
and feasibility of setting up some dyke to arrest the
torrent of innovation and revolution that is bursting in on
every side. All the press almost is silenced, or united on
the other side. &lsquo;John Bull&rsquo; alone fights the battle, but
&lsquo;John Bull&rsquo; defends so many indefensible things that its
advocacy is not worth much. An anti-Radical upon the
plan of the Anti-Jacobin might be of some use, provided it
was well sustained. I wrote a letter yesterday to
Barnes,<a name="FNA_13_07" id="FNA_13_07"></a><a href="#FN_13_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
remonstrating upon the general tone of the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; and
inviting him to adopt some Conservative principles in the
midst of his zeal for Reform. Stanley told me that his
election (at Preston) was lost by the stupidity or ill-will of
the returning officer, who managed the booths in such a
way that Hunt&rsquo;s voters were enabled to vote over and over
at different booths, and that he had no doubt of reducing
his majority on a scrutiny.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_13_07" id="FN_13_07"></a><a href="#FNA_13_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[Mr. Barnes was then editor of the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; newspaper, and retained
that position till his death in 1841. Mr. Greville was well acquainted with
him, and had a high opinion of his talents, character, and influence.]</p></div>

<h3>December 22nd, 1830</h3>

<p>Dudley showed me Phillpotts&rsquo; (Bishop
of Exeter) correspondence with Melbourne and minutes of
conversation on the subject of the commendam of the living
of Stanhope; trimming letters. The Bishop made proposals
to the Government which they rejected, and at last, after
writing one of the ablest letters I ever read, in which he
exposed their former conduct and present motives, he said
that as the Ministers had thought fit to exert the power they
had over him, he should show them that he had some over
them, and appeal to public opinion to decide between them.
On this they gave way, and agreed to an arrangement which,
if not satisfactory to him, will leave him as to income not
much worse off than he was before.</p>

<h3>December 23rd, 1830</h3>

<p>Last night to Wilmot Horton&rsquo;s second
lecture at the Mechanics&rsquo; Institute; I could not go to the
first. He deserves great credit for his exertions, the object
of which is to explain to the labouring classes some of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
truths of political economy, the folly of thinking that the
breaking of machinery will better their condition, and of
course the efficacy of his own plan of emigration. The company
was respectable enough, and they heard him with great
attention. He is full of zeal and animation, but so totally
without method and arrangement that he is hardly intelligible.
The conclusion, which was an attack on Cobbett, was
well done and even eloquent. There were a good many
women, and several wise men, such as Dr. Birkbeck,
M&lsquo;Culloch, and Owen of Lanark.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Connell had a triumphant entry into Dublin, and
advised that no honours should be shown to Lord Anglesey.
They had an interview of two hours in London, when Lord
Anglesey asked him what he intended to do. He said,
&lsquo;Strive <i>totis viribus</i> to effect a repeal of the Union;&rsquo; when
Lord Anglesey told him that he feared he should then be
obliged to govern Ireland by force, so that they are at daggers
drawn. There is not a doubt that Repeal is making rapid
advances.
Moore<a name="FNA_13_08" id="FNA_13_08"></a><a href="#FN_13_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
told me that he had seen extraordinary
signs of it, and that men of the middle classes, intelligent
and well educated, wished for it, though they knew the disadvantages
that would attend a severance of their connection
with England. He said that he could understand it, for as
an Irishman he felt it himself.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_13_08" id="FN_13_08"></a><a href="#FNA_13_08"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
[Thomas Moore, the poet.]</p></div>

<h3>Roehampton, December 26th, 1830</h3>

<p>At Lord Clifden&rsquo;s; Luttrell,
Byng, and Dudley; the latter very mad, did nothing but
soliloquise, walk about, munch, and rail at Reform of every
kind. Lord Anglesey has entered Dublin amidst silence and
indifference, all produced by O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s orders, whose entry
was greeted by the acclamations of thousands, and his
speeches then and since have been more violent than ever.
His authority and popularity are unabated, and he is employing
them to do all the mischief he can, his first object
being to make friends of the Orangemen, to whom he affects
to humble himself, and he has on all public occasions caused
the orange ribband to be joined with the green.</p>

<p>We had a meeting at the Council Office on Friday to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD ANGLESEY AND O&rsquo;CONNELL.</span>
order a prayer &lsquo;on account of the troubled state of certain
parts of the United Kingdom&rsquo;&mdash;great nonsense.</p>

<p>The King of the French has put an end to the disturbances
of Paris about the sentence on the ex-Ministers by a
gallant <i>coup d&rsquo;état.</i> At night, when the streets were most
crowded and agitated, he sallied from the Palais Royal on
horseback, with his son, the Duc de Nemours, and his
personal <i>cortége</i>, and paraded through Paris for two hours.
This did the business; he was received with shouts of
applause, and at once reduced everything to tranquillity.
He deserves his throne for this, and will probably keep it.</p>

<h3>December 30th, 1830</h3>

<p>Notwithstanding the conduct of King
Louis Philippe, and the happy termination of the disorders
and tumults at Paris last week, the greatest alarm still prevails
about the excitement in that place. In consequence of
the Chamber of Deputies having passed some resolutions
altering the constitution of the National Guard, and voting
the post of Commandant-General unnecessary, Lafayette resigned
and has been replaced by Lobau. I never remember
times like these, nor read of such&mdash;the terror and lively
expectation which prevail, and the way in which people&rsquo;s
minds are turned backwards and forwards from France to
Ireland, then range excursively to Poland or Piedmont, and
fix again on the burnings, riots, and executions here.</p>

<p>Lord Anglesey&rsquo;s entry into Dublin turned out not to have
been so mortifying to him as was at first reported. He was
attended by a great number of people, and by all the most
eminent and respectable in Dublin, so much so that he was
very well pleased, and found it better than he expected.
War broke out between him and O&rsquo;Connell without loss of
time. O&rsquo;Connell had intended to have a procession of the
trades, and a notice from him was to have been published
and stuck over the door of every chapel and public place in
Dublin. Anglesey issued his proclamation, and half an hour
before the time when O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s notice was to appear had it
pasted up, and one copy laid on O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s breakfast table,
at which anticipation he chuckled mightily. O&rsquo;Connell
instantly issued a handbill desiring the people to obey, as if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the order of the Lord-Lieutenant was to derive its authority
from his permission, and he afterwards made an able speech.
Since the beginning of the world there never was so extraordinary
and so eccentric a position as his. It is a moral
power and influence as great in its way, and as strangely
acquired, as Bonaparte&rsquo;s political power was. Utterly lost
to all sense of shame and decency, trampling truth and
honour under his feet, cast off by all respectable men, he
makes his faults and his vices subservient to the extension
of his influence, for he says and does whatever suits his
purpose for the moment, secure that no detection or subsequent
exposure will have the slightest effect with those over
whose minds and passions he rules with such despotic sway.
He cares not whom he insults, because, having covered his
cowardice with the cloak of religious scruples, he is invulnerable,
and will resent no retaliation that can be offered him.
He has chalked out to himself a course of ambition which,
though not of the highest kind&mdash;if the <i>consentiens laus
bonorum</i> is indispensable to the aspirations of noble minds&mdash;has
everything in it that can charm a somewhat vulgar but
highly active, restless, and imaginative being; and nobody
can deny to him the praise of inimitable dexterity, versatility,
and even prudence in the employment of the means which
he makes conducive to his ends. He is thoroughly acquainted
with the audiences which he addresses and the people upon
whom he practises, and he operates upon their passions with
the precision of a dexterous anatomist who knows the direction
of every muscle and fibre of the human frame. After
having been throughout the Catholic question the furious
enemy of the Orangemen, upon whom he lavished incessant
and unmeasured abuse, he has suddenly turned round, and
inviting them to join him on the Repeal question, has not
only offered them a fraternal embrace and has humbled himself
to the dust in apologies and demands for pardon, but he
has entirely and at once succeeded, and he is now as popular
or more so with the Protestants (or rather Orangemen) as he
was before with the Catholics, and Crampton writes word
that the lower order of Protestants are with him to a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A DINNER AT THE ATHENÆUM.</span>
Came up to town yesterday to dine with
the Villiers at a dinner of clever men, got up at the
Athenæum, and was extremely bored. The original party
was broken up by various excuses, and the vacancies supplied
by men none of whom I knew. There were Poulett
Thomson, three Villiers, Taylor, Young, whom I knew; the
rest I never saw before&mdash;Buller, Romilly, Senior,
Maule,<a name="FNA_13_09" id="FNA_13_09"></a><a href="#FN_13_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
a man whose name I forget, and Walker, a police magistrate,
all men of more or less talent and information, and altogether
producing anything but an agreeable party. Maule was
senior wrangler and senior medallist at Cambridge, and is
a lawyer. He was nephew to the man with whom I was at
school thirty years ago, and I had never seen him since; he
was then a very clever boy, and assisted to teach the boys,
being admirably well taught himself by his uncle, who was
an excellent scholar and a great brute. I have young Maule
now in my mind&rsquo;s eye suspended by the hair of his head
while being well caned, and recollect as if it was yesterday
his doggedly drumming a lesson of Terence into my dull and
reluctant brain as we walked up and down the garden walk
before the house. When I was introduced to him I had no
recollection of him, but when I found out who he was I went
up to him with the blandest manner as he sat reading a
newspaper, and said that &lsquo;I believed we had once been well
acquainted, though we had not met for twenty-seven years.&rsquo;
He looked up and said, &lsquo;Oh, it is too long ago to talk about,&rsquo;
and then turned back to his paper. So I set him down for a
brute like his uncle and troubled him no further. I am very
sure that dinners of all fools have as good a chance of being
agreeable as dinners of all clever people; at least the former
are often gay, and the latter are frequently heavy. Nonsense
and folly gilded over with good breeding and <i>les usages du
monde</i> produce often more agreeable results than a collection
of rude, awkward intellectual powers.</p>

[Afterwards Mr. Justice Maule.]</p></div>

<h3>Roehampton, January 4th, 1831</h3>

<p>Called on Lady Canning this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
morning, who wanted me to read some of her papers. Most
of them (which are very curious) I had seen before, but forgotten.
I read the long minute of Canning&rsquo;s conversation
with the King ten days before his Majesty put the formation
of the Administration in his hands. They both appear to
have been explicit enough. The King went through his
whole life, and talked for two hours and a half, particularly
about the Catholic question, on which he said he had always
entertained the same opinions&mdash;the same as those of
George III. and the Duke of York&mdash;and that with the
speech of the latter he entirely concurred, except in the &lsquo;so
help me God&rsquo; at the end, which he thought unnecessary.
He said <i>he</i> had wished the Coronation Oath to be altered,
and had proposed it to Lord Liverpool. His great anxiety
was not to be annoyed with the discussion of the question, to
keep Canning and Lord Liverpool&rsquo;s colleagues, and to put at
the head of the Treasury some anti-Catholic Peer. This
Canning would not hear of; he said that having lost Lord
Liverpool he had lost his only support in the Cabinet, that
the King knew how he had been thwarted by others, and
how impossible it would have been for him to go on but for
Lord Liverpool, that he could not serve <i>under</i> anybody else,
or act with efficacy except as First Minister, that he would
not afford in his person an example of any such rule as that
support of the Catholic question was to be <i>ipso facto</i> an exclusion
from the chief office of the Government, that he advised
the King to try and make an anti-Catholic Ministry,
and thought that with his feelings and opinions on the
subject it was what he ought to do. This the King said was
out of the question. In the course of the discussion Canning
said that if he continued in his service he must continue
as free as he had been before; that desirous as he was to
contribute to the King&rsquo;s ease and comfort, he could not in
any way pledge himself on the subject, because he should
be assuredly questioned in the House of Commons, and he
must have it in his power to reply that he was perfectly free
to act on that question as he had ever done, and that he
thought the King would better consult his own ease by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUKE AND MR. CANNING.</span>
retaining him in office without any pledge, relying on his
desire above all things to consult his Majesty&rsquo;s ease and
comfort. He said among other things that, though leader
of the House of Commons, he had never had any patronage
placed at his disposal, nor a single place to give away.</p>

<p>About the time of this conversation Canning was out of
humour with the Duke of Wellington, for he had heard that
many of the adherents of Government who pretended to be
attached to the Duke had spoken of him (Canning) in the
most violent and abusive terms. In their opinions he conceived
the Duke to be to a certain degree implicated, and
this produced some coldness in his manner towards him.
Shortly after Arbuthnot came to him, complained first
and explained after, and said the Duke would call upon him.
The Duke did call, and in a conversation of two hours Canning
told him all that had passed between himself and the
King, thereby putting the Duke, as he supposed, in complete
possession of his sentiments as to the reconstruction of the
Government. A few days after Mr. Canning was charged by
the King to lay before him the plan of an Administration,
and upon this he wrote the letter to his former colleagues
which produced so much discussion. I read the letters to the
Duke, Bathurst, Melville, and Bexley, and I must say that
the one to the Duke was rather the stiffest of the
whole,<a name="FNA_13_10" id="FNA_13_10"></a><a href="#FN_13_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
though it was not so cold as the Duke chose to consider it.
Then came his letter to the Duke on his speech, and the
Duke&rsquo;s answer. When I read these last year I thought the
Duke had much the best of it; but I must alter this opinion
if it be true that he knew Mr. Canning&rsquo;s opinions, as it is
stated that he did entirely, after their long interview, at
which the conversation with the King was communicated to
him. That materially alters the case. There was a letter
from Peel declining, entirely on the ground of objecting to a
pro-Catholic Premier, and on the impossibility of his administering
Ireland with the First Lord of the Treasury of a
different opinion on that subject from his own. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
likewise a curious correspondence relative to a paper written
by the Duke of York during his last illness, and not very long
before his death, to Lord Liverpool on the dangers of the
country from the progress of the Catholic question, the object
of which (though it was vaguely expressed) was to turn out
the Catholic members and form a Protestant Government for
the purpose of crushing the Catholic interest. This Lord
Liverpool communicated (privately) to Canning, and it was
afterwards communicated to the King, who appears (the
answer was not there) to have given the Duke of York a rap
on the knuckles, for there is a reply of the Duke&rsquo;s to the
King, full of devotion, zeal, and affection to his person, and
disclaiming any intention of breaking up the Government,
an idea which could have arisen only from misconception of
the meaning of his letter by Lord Liverpool. It is very
clear, however, that he did mean that, for his letter could
have meant nothing else. The whole thing is curious, for he
was aware that he was dying, and he says so.</p>

<h3>January 12th, 1831</h3>

<p>Passed two days at Panshanger, but my
room was so cold that I could not sit in it to write. Nobody
there but F. Lamb and J. Russell. Lady Cowper told me
what had passed relative to the negotiation with Melbourne
last year, and which the Duke or his friends denied. The
person who was employed (and whom she did not name) told
F. Lamb that the Duke would take in Melbourne and two
others (I am not sure it was not three), but not Huskisson.
He said that it would be fairer at once to say that those
terms would not be accepted, and to save him therefore from
offering them, that Melbourne would not be satisfied with any
Government which did not include Huskisson and Lord Grey,
and that upon this answer the matter dropped. I don&rsquo;t
think the Duke can be blamed for answering to anybody who
chose to ask him any questions on the subject that he had
<i>made no offer</i>; it was the truth, though not the whole truth,
and a Minister must have some shelter against impertinent
questioners, or he would be at their mercy.
An Envoy is come here from the
Poles,<a name="FNA_13_11" id="FNA_13_11"></a><a href="#FN_13_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
who brought a letter from Prince
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CROKER&rsquo;S BOSWELL.</span>
Czartoryski to Lord Grey, who has not seen him, and whose
arrival has naturally given umbrage to the Lievens.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_13_11" id="FN_13_11"></a><a href="#FNA_13_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a>
[This Envoy was Count Alexander Walewski, a natural son of the
Emperor Napoleon, who afterwards played a considerable part in the affairs
of France and of Europe, especially under the Second Empire. During his
residence in London in 1831 he married Lady Caroline Montagu, a daughter
of the Earl of Sandwich, but she did not live long. I remember calling
upon him in St. James&rsquo;s Place, and seeing cards of invitation for Lady Grey&rsquo;s
assemblies stuck in his glass. The fact is he was wonderfully handsome and
agreeable, and soon became popular in London society.]</p></div>

<h3>January 19th, 1831</h3>

<p>To Roehampton on Saturday till Monday,
having been at the Grove on Friday. George Villiers at the
Grove showed me a Dublin paper with an attack on Stanley&rsquo;s
proclamation, and also a character of Plunket drawn with
great severity and by a masterly hand; it is supposed to
be by Baron Smith, a judge who is very able, but fanciful
and disaffected. He will never suffer any but policemen
or soldiers to be hanged of those whom he tries. George
Villiers came from Hatfield, where he had a conversation
with the Duke of Wellington, who told him that he had committed
a great error in his Administration in not paying
more attention to the press, and in not securing a portion of it
on his side and getting good writers into his employment, that
he had never thought it necessary to do so, and that he was
now convinced what a great mistake it was. At Roehampton
nothing new, except that the Reform plan is supposed to be
settled, or nearly so. Duncannon has been consulted, and he
and one or two more have had meetings with Durham, who
were to lay their joint plans before Lord Grey first, and he
afterwards brought them to the Cabinet.</p>

<p>Ellis told me (a curious thing enough) that Croker (for
his &lsquo;Boswell&rsquo;s Life of Johnson&rsquo;) had collected various anecdotes
from other books, but that the only new and original
ones were those he had got from Lord Stowell, who was a
friend of Johnson, and that he had written them under
Stowell&rsquo;s dictation. Sir Walter Scott wanted to see them,
and Croker sent them to him in Scotland by the post. The
bag was lost; no tidings could be heard of it, Croker had
no copy, and Stowell is in his dotage and can&rsquo;t be got to
dictate again. So much for the anecdote; then comes the
story. I said how surprising this was, for nothing was so
rare as a miscarriage by the post. He said, &lsquo;Not at all, for I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
myself lost <i>two reviews</i> in the same way. I sent them both
to <i>Brougham</i> to forward to Jeffrey (for the &ldquo;Edinburgh&rdquo;),
and <i>they were both lost in the same</i> way!&rsquo; That villain
Brougham!</p>

<p>G. Lamb said that the King is supposed to be in a
bad state of health, and this was confirmed to me by Keate
the surgeon, who gave me to understand that he was going
the way of both his brothers. He will be a great loss in
these times; he knows his business, lets his Ministers do as
they please, but expects to be informed of everything. He
lives a strange life at Brighton, with tagrag and bobtail
about him, and always open house. The Queen is a prude,
and will not let the ladies come <i>décolletées</i> to her parties.
George IV., who liked ample expanses of that sort, would not
let them be covered. In the meantime matters don&rsquo;t seem
more promising either here or abroad. In Ireland there is
open war between Anglesey and O&rsquo;Connell, to whom it is
glory enough (of his sort) to be on a kind of par with the
Viceroy, and to have a power equal to that of the Government.
Anglesey issues proclamation after proclamation, the
other speeches and letters in retort. His breakfasts and
dinners are put down, but he finds other places to harangue
at, and letters he can always publish; but he does not appear
in quite so triumphant an attitude as he did. The O&rsquo;Connell
tribute is said to have failed; no men of property or respectability
join him, and he is after all only the leader of a mob;
but it is a better sort of mob, and formidable from their
numbers, and the organisation which has latterly become an
integral part of mob tactics. Nothing can be more awful
than the state of that country, and everybody expects that
it will be found necessary to strengthen the hands of the
Government with extraordinary powers to put an end to the
prevailing anarchy. O&rsquo;Connell is a coward, and that is the
best chance of his being beaten at last.</p>

<p>Lord Lyndhurst took his seat as Chief Baron yesterday
morning, Alexander retiring without an equivalent, and
only having waited for quarter day. Brougham has had a
violent squabble in his Court with Sugden, who having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">O&rsquo;CONNELL ARRESTED.</span>
bullied the Vice-Chancellor and governed Lyndhurst, has a
mind to do the same by Brougham; besides, he hates him
for the repeated thrashings he got from him in the House of
Commons, and has been heard to say that he will take his
revenge in the Court of Chancery. The present affair was
merely that Brougham began writing, when Sugden stopped
and told him &lsquo;it was no use his going on if his Lordship
would not attend to the argument,&rsquo; and so forth.</p>

<p>I met Lyndhurst at dinner yesterday, who talks of himself
as standing on neutral ground, disconnected with
politics. It is certainly understood that he is not to fight
the battles of the present Government, but of course he is
not to be against them. His example is a lesson to statesmen
to be frugal, for if he had been rich he would have had
a better game before him. He told a curious anecdote about
a trial. There was a (civil) cause in which the jury would
not agree on their verdict. They retired on the evening of
one day, and remained till one o&rsquo;clock the next afternoon,
when, being still disagreed, a juror was drawn. There was
only one juror who held out against the rest&mdash;Mr. Berkeley
(member for Bristol). The case was tried over again, and the
jury were unanimously of Mr. Berkeley&rsquo;s opinion, which was
in fact right, a piece of conscientious obstinacy which prevented
the legal commission of wrong.</p>

<h3>Roehampton, January 22nd, 1831</h3>

<p>The event of the week is
O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s arrest on a charge of conspiracy to defeat the
Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s proclamation. Lord Anglesey writes to
Lady Anglesey thus:&mdash;&lsquo;I am just come from a consultation
of six hours with the law officers, the result of which is a
determination to arrest O&rsquo;Connell, for things are now come
to that pass that the question is whether he or I shall
govern Ireland.&rsquo; We await the result with great anxiety,
for the opinion of lawyers seems divided as to the legality of
the arrest, and laymen can form none.</p>

<h3>January 23rd, 1831</h3>

<p>No news; Master of the Rolls, George
Ponsonby, and George Villiers here. The latter told a
story of Plunket, of his wit. Lord Wellesley&rsquo;s aide-de-camp
Keppel wrote a book of his travels, and called it his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
personal narrative. Lord Wellesley was quizzing it, and
said, &lsquo;Personal narrative? what is a personal narrative? Lord
Plunket, what should you say a personal narrative meant?&rsquo;
Plunket answered, &lsquo;My Lord, you know we lawyers always
understand <i>personal</i> as contradistinguished from <i>real</i>.&rsquo; And
one or two others of Parsons, the Irish barrister. Lord
Norbury on some circuit was on the bench speaking, and an
ass outside brayed so loud that nobody could hear. He exclaimed,
&lsquo;Do stop that noise!&rsquo; Parsons said, &lsquo;My Lord,
there is a great echo here.&rsquo; Somebody said to him one day,
&lsquo;Mr. Parsons, have you heard of my son&rsquo;s robbery?&rsquo; &lsquo;No;
whom has he robbed?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nothing but talk about O&rsquo;Connell and his trial, and we
have more fears he will be acquitted than hopes that he will
be convicted. They still burn in the country, and I heard
the other day that the manufacturing districts, though quiet,
are in a high state of organisation.</p>

<h3>January 25th, 1831</h3>

<p>Met Colonel
Napier<a name="FNA_13_12" id="FNA_13_12"></a><a href="#FN_13_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
last night, and talked
for an hour of the state of the country. He gave me a
curious account of the organisation of the manufacturers in
and about Manchester, who are divided into four different
classes, with different objects, partly political, generally to
better themselves, but with a regular Government, the seat
of which is in the Isle of Man. He says that the agriculturists
are likewise organised in Wiltshire, and that
there is a sort of free-masonry among them; he thinks a
revolution inevitable; and when I told him what Southey
had said&mdash;that if he had money enough he would transport
his family to America&mdash;he said he would not himself leave
England in times of danger, but that he should like to remove
his family if he could.</p>

<p>The King is ill. I hope he won&rsquo;t die; if he does, and
the little girl, we shall have Cumberland, and (though
Lyndhurst said he would make a very good King the other
night) that would be a good moment for dispensing with the
regal office. It is reported that they differ in the Cabinet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">O&rsquo;CONNELL&rsquo;S CASE.</span>
about Reform; probably not true. What a state of terror
and confusion we are in, though it seems to make no
difference.</p>

<h3>January 31st, 1831</h3>

<p>At Roehampton on Saturday; Lord
Robert Spencer and Sir G. Robinson. Agar Ellis had just
resigned the Woods, after asking to be made a Peer, which
they refused. All last week nobody thought of anything but
O&rsquo;Connell, and great was the joy at the charge of Judge Jebb,
the unanimous opinion of the King&rsquo;s Bench, and the finding
of the Grand Jury. Whatever happens, Government are now
justified in the course they have taken; and now he has traversed,
which looks like weakness, and it is the general
opinion that he is beaten; but he is so astute, and so full of
resources, that I would never answer for his being beaten till
I see him in prison or find his popularity gone. The subscription
produced between 7,000&#8467;. and 8,000&#8467;. It is an
extraordinary thing, and the most wonderful effect I ever
heard of the power of moral causes over the human body,
that Lord Anglesey, who has scarcely been out of pain at all
for years during any considerable intervals, has been quite
free from his complaint (the tic douloureux) since he has
been in Ireland; the excitement of these events, and the
influence of that excitement on his nervous system, have
produced this effect. There is a puzzler for philosophy,
and such an amalgamation of moral and physical accidents
as is well worth unravelling for those who are wise enough.</p>

<p>Yesterday there was a dinner at Lord Lansdowne&rsquo;s to
name the Sheriffs, and there was I in attendance on my old
school-fellows and associates Richmond, Durham, Graham,
all great men now!</p>

<span class="i0">While some do laugh, and some do weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus runs the world away.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lord Grey was not there, for he was gone to Brighton
to lay the Reform Bill before the King. What a man
Brougham is; he wants to ride his Chancery steed to the
Devil, as if he had not enough to do. Nothing would satisfy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
him but to come and hear causes in our
Court;<a name="FNA_13_13" id="FNA_13_13"></a><a href="#FN_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
but as I knew
it was only to provoke Leach, I would not let him come, and
told the Lord President we had no causes for him to hear.
He insisted, so did I, and he did not come; but some day
I will invite him, and then he will have forgotten it or have
something else to do, and he won&rsquo;t come. He is a Jupiter-Scapin
if ever there was one.</p>

<h3>February 6th, 1831</h3>

<p>Parliament met again on the 3rd, and
the House of Commons exhibited a great array on the
Opposition benches; nothing was done the first day but the
announcement of the Reform measure for the 2nd of March,
to be brought in by Lord John Russell in the House of Commons,
though not a Cabinet Minister. The fact is that if
a Cabinet Minister had introduced it, it must have been
Althorp, and he is wholly unequal to it; he cannot speak
at all, so that though the pretence is to pay a compliment to
John Russell because he had on former occasions brought
forward plans of Reform, it is really expedient to take the
burden off the leader of the Government. The next night
came on the Civil List, and as the last Government was turned
out on this question, there had existed a general but vague expectation
that some wonderful reductions were to be proposed
by the new Chancellor of the Exchequer. Great, then, was
the exultation of the Opposition when it was found that no
reductions would be made, and that the measure of this
Government only differed from that of the last in the
separation of the King&rsquo;s personal expenses from the other
charges and a <i>prospective</i> reduction in the Pension List.
There was not much of a debate. Althorp did it ill by all
accounts; Graham spoke pretty well; and Calcraft, who
could do nothing while in office, found all his energies
when he got back to the Opposition benches, and made
(everybody says) a capital speech. There is certainly a
great disappointment that the Civil List does not produce
some economical novelty, and to a certain degree the popularity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CIVIL LIST.</span>
of the Government will be affected by it. But they
have taken the manliest course, and the truth is the Duke
of Wellington had already made all possible reductions,
unless the King and the Government were at once to hang out
the flag of poverty and change their whole system.
After what Sefton had told me of the intentions of Government
about the Pension List, and my reply to him, it was
a satisfaction to me to find they could not act on such
a principle; and accordingly Lord Althorp at once declared
the opinion and intentions of Government about
the Pensions, instead of abandoning them to the rage of
the House of Commons. There is not even a surmise as
to the intended measure of Reform, the secret of which is
well kept, but I suspect the confidence of the Reformers will
be shaken by their disappointment about the Civil List.
It is by no means clear, be it what it may, that the
Government will be able to carry it, for the Opposition
promises to be very formidable in point of numbers; and in
speaking the two parties are, as to the first class, pretty
evenly divided&mdash;Palmerston, the Grants, Graham, Stanley,
John Russell, on one side; Peel, Calcraft, Hardinge, Dawson,
on the other; fewer in numbers, but Peel immeasurably
the best on either side&mdash;but in the second line, and among
the younger ones, the Opposition are far inferior.</p>

<h3>February 9th, 1831</h3>

<p>Just got into my new home&mdash;Poulett
Thomson&rsquo;s house, which I have taken for a year. The day
before yesterday came the news that the French had refused
the nomination of the Duc de Nemours to the throne of
Belgium, the news of his being chosen having come on
Sunday. The Ministers were <i>rayonnants</i>; Lord Lansdowne
came to his office and told it me with prodigious glee.</p>

<p>Met with Sir J. Burke on Sunday at Brooks&rsquo;s, who said
that O&rsquo;Connell was completely beaten by the address of the
merchants and bankers, among whom were men&mdash;Mahon, for
instance (O&rsquo;Gorman Mahon&rsquo;s uncle)&mdash;who had always stood
by him. I do not believe he is completely beaten, and his
resources for mischief are so great that he will rally again
before long, I have little doubt. However, what has occurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
has been productive of great good; it has elicited a strong
Conservative demonstration, and proved that out of the rabbleocracy
(for everything is in <i>ocracy</i> now) his power is anything
but unlimited. There are 20,000 men in Ireland, so Lord
Hill told me last night.
Hunt<a name="FNA_13_14" id="FNA_13_14"></a><a href="#FN_13_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
spoke for two hours last
night; his manner and appearance very good, like a country
gentleman of the old school, a sort of rural dignity about it,
very civil, good-humoured, and respectful to the House, but
dull; listened to, however, and very well received.</p>

<h3>February 12th, 1831</h3>

<p>The debate three nights ago on Ireland,
brought on by O&rsquo;Gorman Mahon, is said to have been the
best that has been heard in the House of Commons for many
years. Palmerston, Burdett, Althorp, Peel, Wyse, all made
good speeches; it was spirited, statesmanlike, and creditable
to the House, which wanted some such exhibition to raise its
credit. I saw the day before yesterday a curious letter from
Southey to Brougham, which some day or other will probably
appear. Taylor showed it me. Brougham had written to
him to ask him what his opinion was as to the encouragement
that could be given to literature, by rewarding or
honouring literary men, and suggested (I did not see his
letter) that the Guelphic Order should be bestowed upon
them. Southey&rsquo;s reply was very courteous, but in a style of
suppressed irony and forced politeness, and exhibited the
marks of a chafed spirit, which was kept down by an effort.
&lsquo;You, my Lord, are <i>now</i> on the Conservative side,&rsquo; was one
of his phrases, which implied that the Chancellor had not
always been on that side. He suggested that it might be
useful to establish a sort of lay fellowships; 10,000&#8467;. would
give 10 of 500&#8467;. and 25 of 200&#8467;.; but he proposed them not to
reward the meritorious, but as a means of silencing or hiring
the mischievous. It was evident, however, that he laid no
stress on this plan, or considered it practicable, and only proposed
it because he thought he must suggest something.
He said that honours might be desirable to scientific men, as
they were so considered on the Continent, and Newton and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE FIRST WHIG BUDGET.</span>
Davy had been titled, but for himself, if a <i>Guelphic</i> distinction
was adopted, &lsquo;he should be a <i>Ghibelline</i>.&rsquo; He ended by
saying that all he asked for was a repeal of the Copyright
Act which took from the families of literary men the only
property they had to give them, and this &lsquo;I ask for with the
earnestness of one who is conscious that he has laboured for
posterity.&rsquo; It is a remarkable letter.</p>

<h3>February 13th, 1831</h3>

<p>The Budget, which was brought forward
two nights ago, has given great dissatisfaction; Goulburn
attacked the taxation of the funds (half per cent. on transfer
of stock and land) in the best speech he ever made,
Peel in another good speech. The bankers assailed it one
after another, and not a man on the Government side
spoke decently. Great of course was the exultation of the
Opposition, and it is supposed that this will be withdrawn
and a Property Tax laid on instead. There is a meeting to-day
in Downing Street, at which I suspect it will be announced.
The Budget must appear hurried, and nothing
but the circumstances in which they are placed could have
justified their bringing it on so soon. In two months,
besides having foreign affairs of the greatest consequence on
their hands, they have concocted a Reform Bill and settled
the finances of the nation for the next year, which is quite
ludicrous; but they are obliged to have money voted immediately,
that in case they should be beaten on Reform or any
other vital question which may compel them to dissolve
Parliament, they may have passed their estimates and
be provided with funds. Their secrets are well kept&mdash;rather
too well, for nobody knew of this Budget, and not a
soul has a guess what their Reform is to be. At present
nothing can cut a poorer figure than the Government does in
the House of Commons, and they have shown how weak a
Government a strong Opposition may make.</p>

<p>I have just been to hear Benson preach at the Temple,
but I was so distant that I heard ill. His manner is impressive,
and language good without being ambitious, but I
was rather disappointed. Brougham was there, with Lord
King of all people!</p>

<h3>February 15th, 1831</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Yesterday morning news came that
O&rsquo;Connell had withdrawn his plea of not guilty and (by his
counsel, Mr. Perrin) pleaded guilty, to the unutterable astonishment
of everybody, and not less delight. Sheil wrote
word that his heart sank at the terror of a gaol, and &lsquo;how
would such a man face a battle, who could not encounter
Newgate?&rsquo; Everybody&rsquo;s impression was that it was a
compromise with the law officers, and that he pleaded guilty
on condition that he should not be brought up for judgment,
but it was no such thing; he made in the preceding days several
indirect overtures to Lord Anglesey, who would listen to
nothing, and told him that after his conduct he could do
nothing for him, and that he must take his own course.
He comes to England directly, and will be brought up for
judgment (if at all, which I doubt) next term. He gives out
that he was forced to do this in order to hasten to England
and repair in the House of Commons the errors of O&rsquo;Gorman
Mahon. There is no calculating what may be the extent of
the credulity of an Irish mob with regard to him, but after
all his bullies and bravadoes this will hardly go down even
with them. Sheil says &lsquo;O&rsquo;Connell is fallen indeed.&rsquo; I trust,
though hardly dare hope, that &lsquo;he sinks like stars that fall
to rise no more.&rsquo; It is impossible to form an idea of the astonishment
of everybody at this termination of the law proceedings,
which have ended so triumphantly for Lord Anglesey
and Plunket. Lord Anglesey, however, wrote word
to Lady Anglesey that no one could form an idea of the state
of that country: that fresh plots were discovered every day,
that from circumstances he had been able to do more than
another man would, but that it was not, he firmly believed,
possible to save it.</p>

<p>There was a meeting at Althorp&rsquo;s on Sunday, when he
agreed to withdraw the Transfer Tax, and that there should
be no Property Tax. A more miserable figure was never cut
than his; but how should it be otherwise? A respectable
country gentleman, well versed in rural administration, in
farming and sporting, with all the integrity of 15,000&#8467;. a
year in possession and 50,000&#8467;. in reversion, is all of a sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD ALTHORP&rsquo;S BUDGET.</span>
made leader in the House of Commons without being able
to speak, and Chancellor of the Exchequer without any knowledge,
theoretical or practical, of finance. By way of being
discreet, and that his plan may be a secret, he consults nobody;
and then he closets himself with his familiar Poulett
Thomson, who puts this notable scheme into his head, and out
he blurts it in the House of Commons, without an idea how
it will be received, without making either preparations for
defending it or for an alternative in case of its rejection. If
Althorp and Poulett Thomson are to govern England, these
things are likely to happen. The Opposition cannot contain
themselves; the women think they are to come in directly.
Goulburn said to Baring as they left the House on Friday,
&lsquo;Mr. Baring, you said last year you thought my Budget was
the most profligate that any Chancellor of the Exchequer had
ever brought forward; I think you will now no longer say it
was the <i>most</i> profligate.&rsquo; Last night
Praed<a name="FNA_13_15" id="FNA_13_15"></a><a href="#FN_13_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
made his first
speech, which was very good.</p>

[Winthrop Mackworth Praed, a young man of great promise, who had
just entered Parliament. He took his degree in 1825, and was regarded by
the Tories as the rival and competitor of Thomas Babington Macaulay.
But unhappily he died in 1839.]</p></div>

<h3>February 17th, 1831</h3>

<p>The day before yesterday Duncannon
called on me, and told me O&rsquo;Connell had got up an opposition
to him in Kilkenny; that he was of opinion that the
recent events would diminish neither his power nor his popularity,
and that in fact he was infallible with the Irish mob.
As Richard says, &lsquo;if this have no effect, he is immortal.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington called on my family yesterday;
he says the Reform question will not be carried, and he
thinks the Government cannot stand, that things are certainly
better (internally), and that the great fear is lest people
should be too much afraid.</p>

<p>Went to Lady Dudley Stewart&rsquo;s last night; a party; saw
a vulgar-looking, fat man with spectacles, and a mincing,
rather pretty pink and white woman, his wife. The man was
Napoleon&rsquo;s nephew, the woman Washington&rsquo;s granddaughter.
What a host of associations, all confused and degraded! He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
is a son of Murat, the King of Naples, who was said to be
&lsquo;le dieu Mars jusqu&rsquo;à six heures du soir.&rsquo; He was heir to a
throne, and is now a lawyer in the United States, and his
wife, whose name I know not, Sandon told me, was Washington&rsquo;s
granddaughter. (This must be a mistake, for I
think Washington never had any
children.)<a name="FNA_13_16" id="FNA_13_16"></a><a href="#FN_13_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_13_16" id="FN_13_16"></a><a href="#FNA_13_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a>
[Achille Murat and his wife were living at this time in the Alpha
Road, Regent&rsquo;s Park. It was said she was Washington&rsquo;s grand-niece, but
I am not sure what the relationship was, if any. She was certainly not his
granddaughter.]</p></div>

<h3>February 24th, 1831</h3>

<p>At Newmarket for three days, from
Saturday till Tuesday; riding out at eight o&rsquo;clock every
morning and inhaling salubrious air. Came back the night
before last and found matters in a strange state. The
Government, strong in the House of Lords (which is a
secondary consideration), is weak in the House of Commons
to a degree which is contemptible and ridiculous.
Even Sefton now confesses that Althorp is wretched. There
he is <i>leading</i> the House of Commons without the slightest
acquaintance with the various subjects that come under discussion,
and hardly able to speak at all; not one of the
Ministers exhibits anything like vigour, ability, or discretion.
As Althorp cannot speak, Graham is obliged to talk, or
thinks he is, and, as I predicted, he is
failing;<a name="FNA_13_17" id="FNA_13_17"></a><a href="#FN_13_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
with some
cleverness and plenty of fluency, he is unequal to the situation
he is placed in, and his difference with Grant the other
night and his apology to O&rsquo;Gorman Mahon have been prejudicial
to the Government and to his own character. The
exultation of the Opposition is unbounded, and Peel plays
with his power in the House, only not putting it forth because
it does not suit his convenience; but he does what he
likes, and it is evident that the very existence of the Government
depends upon his pleasure. His game, however, is to
display candour and moderation, and rather to protect them
than not, so he defends many of their measures and restrains
the fierce animosity of his friends, but with a sort of sarcastic
civility, which, while it is put forth in their defence, is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WEAKNESS OF THE GOVERNMENT.</span>
always done in such a manner as shall best exhibit his own
authority and his contempt for their persons individually.
While he upholds the Government he does all he can to
bring each member of it into contempt, and there they are,
helpless and confused, writhing under his lash and their own
impotence, and only intent upon staving off a division which
would show the world how feeble they are. Neither the
late nor any other Government ever cut so poor a figure as
this does. Palmerston does nothing, Grant does worse,
Graham does no good, Althorp a great deal of harm; Stanley
alone has distinguished himself, and what he has had to do
has done very well. It is not, however, only in the House
of Commons that the Government are in such discredit; the
Budget did their business in the City, and alienated the trading
interest. It is a curious circumstance that both Goulburn
and Herries have been beset by deputations and individual
applications for advice and assistance nearly as much
since they left office as when they were in it by merchants
and others, who complain to them that it was quite useless
to go to Lord Althorp, for they find that he has not
the slightest acquaintance with any of the subjects and
interests on which they addressed themselves to him, and
one man told Herries this, at the same time owning that he
was a Whig in principle, and had been an opponent of the
late and a supporter of the present Government. The press
generally are falling off from the Government, which is an
ominous sign. While the Government is thus weak and
powerless the elements of confusion and violence are gathering
fresh force, and without any fixed and loyal authority to
check them will pursue their eccentric course till some public
commotion arrives, or till the Conservative resources of the
country are called into action and the antagonistic principles
are fairly brought to trial.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_13_17" id="FN_13_17"></a><a href="#FNA_13_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a>
It was on Lord Chandos&rsquo;s motion to take into consideration the state
of the West Indies.</p></div>

<p>The King went to the play the night before last; was well
received in the house, but hooted and pelted coming home,
and a stone shivered a window of his coach and fell into
Prince George of Cumberland&rsquo;s lap. The King was excessively
annoyed, and sent for Baring, who was the officer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
riding by his coach, and asked him if he knew who had
thrown the stone; he said that it terrified the Queen, and
&lsquo;was very disagreeable, as he should always be going somewhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the House of Commons Committee on the Parliament
Offices they are making the whole thing ridiculous by the
sort of reductions they suggest. Hume proposed to cut
down the President of the Council to 1,000&#8467;. a year, on
which Stormont moved he should have nothing, and this
(which was intended to ridicule Hume&rsquo;s proposal) was carried,
but will probably be rescinded. There is no directing
power anywhere, and the sort of anarchy that is fast increasing
must beget confusion. Nobody has the least idea
how reform will go, or of the nature of what they mean to
propose, but the King said to Cecil Forrester yesterday, who
went to resign his office of Groom of the Bedchamber, &lsquo;Why
do you resign?&rsquo; He said he could not support Government
or vote for Reform. &lsquo;Well, but you don&rsquo;t know what it is,
and you might have waited till it came on, for it probably will
not be carried;&rsquo; and this he repeated twice. Lord Durham
has volunteered to give up his salary as Privy Seal, which is
no great sacrifice, considering how long he is likely to enjoy
it, and everybody gives him credit for having suggested the
relief to coals for his own interest. Lady Holland, who has
got a West Indian estate, attacked him about the sugar
duties, and asked him if they would not reduce them. He
said &lsquo;No.&rsquo; She retorted, &lsquo;That is because you have no West
Indian estate; you have got your own job about coals done,
and you don&rsquo;t care about us.&rsquo; In the House of Lords they
have it all their own way. The other night, on Lord Strangford&rsquo;s
motion about the Methuen treaty, Brougham exhibited
his wonderful powers in his very best style. Without any
preparation for the question, and after it had been exhausted
in a very good speech of Goderich&rsquo;s, he got up, and in answer
to Strangford and Ellenborough banged their heads together,
and displayed all his power of ridicule, sarcasm, and argument
in a manner which they could not themselves help
admiring. The next night he brought forward his Chancery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LADY JERSEY AND LORD DURHAM.</span>
Reform measure in a speech of three hours, which, however
luminous, was too long for their Lordships, and before the
end of it the House had melted away to nothing. But, notwithstanding
this success, he must inwardly chafe at being
removed from his natural element and proper sphere of
action, and he must burn with vexation at seeing Peel riot
and revel in his unopposed power, like Hector when Achilles
would not fight, though this Achilles can never fight again,
but he would give a great deal to go back to the field, and
would require much less persuasion than Achilles did.</p>

<h3>February 25th, 1831</h3>

<p>A drawing-room yesterday, at which the
Princess Victoria made her first appearance. I was not
there. Lady Jersey made a scene with Lord Durham. She
got up and crossed the room to him and said, &lsquo;Lord Durham,
I hear that you have said things about me which are not
true, and I desire that you will call upon me to-morrow with
a witness to hear my positive denial, and I beg that you will
not repeat any such things about me,&rsquo; or, as the Irishman
said, &lsquo;words to that effect.&rsquo; She was in a fury, and he, I
suppose, in a still greater. He muttered that he should
never set foot in her house again, which she did not hear, as
after delivering herself of her speech she flounced back again
to her seat, mighty proud of the exploit. It arose out of his
saying that he should make Lady Durham demand an
audience of the Queen to contradict the things Lady Jersey
had said of her and the other Whig ladies.</p>

<p>I saw Lady Jersey last night and had a long conversation
with her about her squabbles. She declares
solemnly (and I believe it) that she never said a syllable to
the Queen against her quondam friends, owns she abused
Sefton to other people, cried, and talked, and the end was
that I am to try to put an end to these <i>tracasseries</i>. She
was mighty glorious about her <i>sortie</i> upon Lambton, whom
she dislikes, but she is vexed at the hornets&rsquo; nest she has
brought round her head. All this comes of talking. The
wisest man mentioned in history was the vagrant in the
Tuileries Gardens some years ago, who walked about with
a gag on, and when taken up by the police and questioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
why he went about in that guise, he said he was imprudent,
and that he might not say anything to get himself into
jeopardy he had adopted this precaution. I wonder what
Lambton would say now about appointing others instead
of Palmerston and Co. if they should go out, which he talked
of as such an easy and indifferent matter. What arrogance
and folly there is in the world! I don&rsquo;t know how long this
will last, but it must end in Peel&rsquo;s being Prime Minister.
What a foolish proverb that is that &lsquo;honesty is the best
policy!&rsquo;</p>

<p>I am just come home from breakfasting with Henry Taylor
to meet Wordsworth; the same party as when he had Southey&mdash;Mill,
Elliot, Charles Villiers. Wordsworth may be bordering
on sixty; hard-featured, brown, wrinkled, with prominent
teeth and a few scattered grey hairs, but nevertheless
not a disagreeable countenance; and very cheerful, merry,
courteous, and talkative, much more so than I should have
expected from the grave and didactic character of his writings.
He held forth on poetry, painting, politics, and metaphysics,
and with a great deal of eloquence; he is more conversible
and with a greater flow of animal spirits than Southey. He
mentioned that he never wrote down as he composed, but
composed walking, riding, or in bed, and wrote down after;
that Southey always composes at his desk. He talked a
great deal of Brougham, whose talents and domestic virtues
he greatly admires; that he was very generous and affectionate
in his disposition, full of duty and attention to his
mother, and had adopted and provided for a whole family of
his brother&rsquo;s children, and treats his wife&rsquo;s children as if they
were his own. He insisted upon taking them both with him
to the drawing-room the other day when he went in state
as Chancellor. They remonstrated with him, but in vain.</p>

<h3>March 2nd, 1831</h3>

<p>The great day at length arrived, and yesterday
Lord John Russell moved for leave to bring in his Reform
Bill. To describe the curiosity, the intensity of the expectation
and excitement, would be impossible, and the secret
had been so well kept that not a soul knew what the
measure was (though most people guessed pretty well) till
they heard it. He rose at six o&rsquo;clock, and spoke for two
hours and a quarter&mdash;a sweeping measure indeed, much
more so than anyone had imagined, because the Ministers
had said it was one which would give <i>general</i> satisfaction,
whereas this must dissatisfy all the moderate and will
probably just stop short enough not to satisfy the Radicals.
They say it was ludicrous to see the faces of the members
for those places which are to be disfranchised as they were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
severally announced, and Wetherell, who began to take
notes, as the plan was gradually developed, after sundry
contortions and grimaces and flinging about his arms and
legs, threw down his notes with a mixture of despair and
ridicule and horror. Not many people spoke last night:
Inglis followed John Russell, and Francis Leveson closed the
debate in the best speech he has ever made, though rather
too flowery. Everything is easy in these days, otherwise
how Palmerston, Goderich, and Grant can have joined in a
measure of this sweeping, violent, and speculative character
it is difficult to conceive, they who were the disciples of
Castlereagh and the adherents of Canning; but after the
Duke of Wellington and Peel carrying the Catholic question,
Canning&rsquo;s friends advocating Radical Reform, and Eldon
living to see Brougham on the Woolsack, what may one not
expect?</p>

<p>What everybody enquires is what line Peel will take, and
though each party is confident of success in this question, it
is thought to depend mainly upon the course he adopts and
the sentiments he expresses. Hitherto he has cautiously
abstained from committing himself in any way, and he is
free to act as he thinks best, but he certainly occupies a
grand position when he has <i>omnium oculos in se conversos</i>,
and the whole House of Commons looking with unalterable
anxiety to his opinions and conduct. Such has the course
of events and circumstances made this man, who is probably
yet destined to play a great part, and it may be a very
useful one. God knows how this plan may be received in
the country, and what may be its fate in Parliament. The
Duke of Wellington, however, is right enough when he says
that the great present danger is lest people should be too
much afraid, for anything like the panic that prevails I
never saw, the apprehension that enough will not be done
to satiate the demon of popular opinion, and the disposition
to submit implicitly to the universal bellow that pervades
this country for what they call Reform without knowing
what it is. As to this measure, the greatest evil of it is that
it is a pure speculation, and may be productive of the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE FIRST REFORM BILL.</span>
consequences, or the worst, or even of none at all, for all that
its authors and abettors can explain to us or to themselves.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Connell made his explanation the other night, which
was wretched, and Stanley&rsquo;s was very good, but it matters
not; he will tell the people in Ireland that he had a victory,
and they will believe him. Nevertheless his defeat in Kilkenny
is an excellent thing, and will contribute greatly to
destroy the prestige of his power.</p>

<h3>March 3rd, 1831</h3>

<p>Last night the debate went on, nobody
remarkably speaking but Macaulay and Wetherell; the
former very brilliant, the latter long, rambling, and amusing,
and he sat down with such loud and long cheering as everybody
agreed they had never heard before in the House of
Commons, and which was taken not so much as a test of the
merits of the speech as of an indication of the disposition
of the majority of the House. Wetherell was very good
fun in a conversation he imagined at Cockermouth between
Sir James Graham and one of his constituents. It is
thought very strange that none of the Ministers have spoken,
except Althorp the first night. The general opinion is
that the Bill will be lost in the House of Commons, and that
then Parliament will be dissolved, unless the King should
take fright and prefer to change his Ministers.</p>

<h3>March 5th, 1831</h3>

<p>On Thursday night the great speeches were
those of Hobhouse on one side and Peel on the other, which
last was received with the greatest enthusiasm, and some said
(as usual) that it was the finest oration they had ever heard
within the walls of Parliament; it seems by the report of it
to have been very able and very eloquent. The people come
into the &lsquo;Travellers&rsquo; after the debate, and bring their different
accounts all tinctured by their particular opinions and prejudices,
so that the exact truth of the relative merits of
the speakers is only attainable by the newspaper reports,
imperfect as they are, the next day. The excitement is
beyond anything I ever saw. Last night Stanley answered
Peel in an excellent speech and one which is likely to raise
his reputation very high. He is evidently desirous of pitting
himself against Peel, whom he dislikes; and it is probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
that they are destined to be the rival leaders of two great
Parliamentary parties, if things settle down into the ancient
practices of Parliamentary warfare. The other events of
last night were the resignation of Charles Wynne and his
opposition to the Bill, and the unexpected defection from
Government of Lord Seymour, the Duke of Somerset&rsquo;s son,
and Jeffrey&rsquo;s speech, which was very able, but somewhat
tedious.</p>

<h3>March 7th, 1831</h3>

<p>Nothing talked of, thought of, dreamt of,
but Reform. Every creature one meets asks, What is said
now? How will it go? What is the last news? What do <i>you</i>
think? and so it is from morning till night, in the streets, in
the clubs, and in private houses. Yesterday morning met
Hobhouse; told him how well I heard he had spoken, and
asked him what he thought of Peel&rsquo;s speech; he said it was
brilliant, imposing, but not much in it. Everybody cries up
(more than usual) the speeches on their own side, and despises
those on the other, which is peculiarly absurd, because the
speaking has been very good, and there is so much to be
said on both sides that the speech of an adversary may be
applauded without any admission of his being in the right.
Hobhouse told me he had at first been afraid that his constituents
would disapprove this measure, as so many of them
would be disfranchised, but that they had behaved nobly and
were quite content and ready to make any sacrifices for such
an object. I asked him if he thought it would be carried;
he said he did not like to think it would not, for he was
desirous of keeping what he had, and he was persuaded he
should lose it if the Bill were rejected. I said it was an
unlucky dilemma when one-half of the world thought like
him and the other half were equally convinced that if it be
carried they shall lose everything.</p>

<p>Dined at Boodle&rsquo;s with the Master of the Rolls and
Charles Grant, who talked about Peel and the reconstruction
of the Tory party; that Peel and Wetherell do not <i>yet</i>
speak, but that the parties have joined, and at the meeting
at Wetherell&rsquo;s Herries went to represent Peel with sixteen
or eighteen of his friends. Ross, another of Peel&rsquo;s <i>âmes</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE FIRST SIR ROBERT PEEL.</span>
<i>damnées</i>, told me the same thing and that they would soon
come together again. Grant said he knew that the Duke of
Wellington had expressed his readiness to take any part in
which it was thought he could render service, either a
prominent or a subordinate one or none at all. If so he
will be a greater man than he has ever been yet.</p>

<p>Grant talked long and pathetically about the West Indies,
and told me a curious anecdote on the authority of Scarlett,
who was present. When Wilberforce went out of Parliament
he went to Canning and offered him the lead and
direction of his party (the Saints), urging him to accept it,
and assuring him that their support would give him a
strength which to an ambitious man like him was invaluable.
Canning took three days to consider it, but finally
declined, and then the party elected Brougham as their
chief; hence the representation of Yorkshire and many other
incidents in Brougham&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p>Grant gave me a curious account of old Sir Robert Peel.
He was the younger son of a merchant, his fortune (very
small) left to him in the house, and he was not to take it out.
He gave up the fortune and started in business without a
shilling, but as the active partner in a concern with two
other men&mdash;Yates (whose daughter he afterwards married)
and another&mdash;who between them made up 6,000&#8467;.; from
this beginning he left 250,000&#8467;. apiece to his five younger
sons, 60,000&#8467;. to his three daughters each, and 22,000&#8467;. a year
in land and 450,000&#8467;. in the funds to Peel. In his lifetime he
gave Peel 12,000&#8467;. a year, the others 3,000&#8467;. and spent 3,000&#8467;.
himself. He was always giving them money, and for objects
which it might have been thought he would have undervalued.
He paid for Peel&rsquo;s house when he built it, and for the Chapeau
de Paille (2,700 guineas) when he bought it.</p>

<h3>March 10th, 1831</h3>

<p>The debate has gone on, and is to be over
to-night; everybody heartily sick of it, but the excitement as
great as ever. Last night O&rsquo;Connell was very good, and
vehemently cheered by the Government, Stanley, Duncannon,
and all, all differences giving way to their zeal; Attwood,
the other way, good; Graham a total failure, got into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
nautical terms and a simile about a ship, in which he
floundered and sank. Sir J. Yorke quizzed him with great
effect. To-day the City went up with their address, to which
the King gave a very general answer. There was great
curiosity to know what his answer would be. I rather think
this address was got up by Government. Brougham had
written to Liverpool <i>to encourage the Reformers there</i>, as he
owned to George Villiers last night; and Pearson was with
Ellice at the Treasury for an hour the day before this
address was moved in the City. They have gone so far
that they certainly wish for agitation here. The Duke of
Wellington is alarmed; nobody guesses how the question
will go. Went to Lady Jersey the day before yesterday to
read her correspondence with Brougham, who flummeried
her over with notes full of affection and praise, to which she
responded in the same strain, and so they are friends again.
While I was reading her reply the Duke of Wellington came
in, on which she huddled it up, and I conclude he has not
seen her effusion. News arrived that the Poles have been
beaten and have submitted. There is a great fall in the
French funds, as they are expected not to pay their dividends.
Europe is in a nice mess. The events of a quarter of a
century would hardly be food for a week now-a-days.</p>

<h3>March 11th, 1831</h3>

<p>It is curious to see the change of opinion
as to the passing of this Bill. The other day nobody would
hear of the possibility of it, now everybody is beginning to
think it will be carried. The tactics of the Opposition have
been very bad, for they ought to have come to a division
immediately, when I think Government would have been
beaten, but it was pretty certain that if they gave time to
the country to declare itself the meetings and addresses
would fix the wavering and decide the doubtful. There
certainly never was anything like the unanimity which pervades
the country on the subject, and though I do not think
they will break out into rebellion if it is lost, it is impossible
not to see that the feeling for it (kept alive as it will be by
every sort of excitement) must prevail and that if this
particular Bill is not carried some other must very like it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PROBABLE RESULTS OF THE REFORM BILL.</span>
and which, if it is much short of this, will only leave a peg to
hang fresh discussions upon. The Government is desperate
and sees no chance of safety but from their success in the
measure, but I have my doubts whether they will render
themselves immortal by it. It is quite impossible to guess
at its effects at present upon the House of Commons in
the first return which may be made under it, but if a vast
difference is not made, and if it shall still leave to property
and personal influence any great extent of power, the Tory
party, which is sure to be revived, will in all probability be
too strong for the Reforming Whigs. The Duke of Wellington
expected to gain strength by passing the Catholic
question, whereas he was ruined by it.</p>

<h3>March 15th, 1831</h3>

<p>It is universally believed that this Bill will
pass, except by some of the ultras against it, or by the fools.
But what next? That nobody can tell, though to see the
exultation of the Government one would imagine they saw
their way clearly to a result of wonderful good. I have little
doubt that it will be read a second time, and be a good deal
battled in Committee. Although they are determined to
carry it through the Committee with a high hand, and not to
suffer any alterations, probably some sort of compromise in
matters of inferior moment will be made. But when it
comes into operation how disappointed everybody will be,
and first of all the people! Their imaginations are raised to
the highest pitch, but they will open their eyes very wide
when they find no sort of advantage accruing to them, when
they are deprived of much of the expense and more of the
excitement of elections, and see a House of Commons constructed
after their own hearts, which will probably be an
assembly in all respects inferior to the present. Then they
will not be satisfied, and as it will be impossible to go back,
there will be plenty of agitators who will preach that we
have not gone far enough; and if a Reformed Parliament
does not do all that popular clamour shall demand, it will be
treated with very little ceremony. If, however, it be true
that the tendency of this Bill will be to throw power into the
hands of the landed interest, we shall have a great Tory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
party, which will be selfish, bigoted, and ignorant, and a
Radical party, while the Whig party, who will have carried
the measure, will sink into insignificance. Such present
themselves to my mind as possible alternatives, as far as it is
practicable to take anything like a view of probabilities in
the chaos and confusion that mighty alterations like these
produce.</p>

<p>I dined with Lord Grey on Sunday; they are all in high
spirits. Howick told his father that he had received a letter
from some merchant in the north praising the Bill, and
saying he approved of the whole Government except of
Poulett Thomson. In the evening Brougham, John Russell,
and others arrived. I hear of Brougham from Sefton,
with whom he passes most of his spare time, to relieve his
mind by small talk, <i>persiflage</i>, and the gossip of the day.
He tells Sefton &lsquo;that he likes his office, but that it is a mere
plaything and there is nothing to do; his life is too idle, and
when he has cleared off the arrears, which he shall do forthwith,
that he really does not know how he shall get rid of
his time;&rsquo; that &lsquo;he does not suffer the prolixity of counsel,
and when they wander from the point he brings them back
and says, &ldquo;You need not say anything on that point; what
I want to be informed upon is so.&rdquo; He is a wonderful
man, the most extraordinary I ever saw, but there is more
of the mountebank than of greatness in all this. It may
do well enough for Sefton, who is as ignorant as he is sharp
and shrewd, and captivated with his congenial offhandism,
but it requires something more than Brougham&rsquo;s flippant
<i>ipse dixit</i> to convince me that the office of Chancellor
is such a sinecure and bagatelle. He had a levee the
other night, which was brilliantly attended&mdash;the Archbishops,
Duke of Wellington, Lord Grey, a host of people.
Sefton goes and sits in his private room and sees his receptions
of people, and gives very amusing accounts of his
extreme politeness to the Lord Mayor and his cool <i>insouciance</i>
with the Archbishop of Canterbury. The stories of
him as told by Sefton would be invaluable to his future
biographer, and never was a life more sure to be written
hereafter.</p>

<span class="pagehead">BROUGHAM AT THE HORSE GUARDS.</span>
The night before last Wynford attacked
Brougham&rsquo;s Bill, and got lashed in return with prodigious
severity. He is resolved to press it, though George Villiers
told me he had promised Lyndhurst to wait for his
return to town. Notwithstanding his vapouring about the
Court of Chancery, and treating it as such child&rsquo;s play,
Leach affirms (but he is disappointed and hates him) that he
is a very bad judge and knows nothing of his business. &lsquo;He
was a very bad advocate; why should he make a good
judge?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Reform Bill is just printed, and already are the
various objections raised against different parts of it, sufficient
to show that it will be pulled to pieces in Committee.
Both parties confident of success on the second
reading, but the country <i>will</i> have it; there is a determination
on the subject, and a unanimity perfectly marvellous,
and no demonstration of the unfitness of any of its parts will
be of any avail; some of its details may be corrected and
amended, but substantially it must pass pretty much as
it is.</p>

<p>Brougham has been getting into a squabble with the
military. At the drawing-room on Thursday they refused to let
his carriage pass through the Horse Guards, when he ordered
his coachman to force his way through, which he did. He
was quite wrong, and it was very unbecoming and undignified.
Lord Londonderry called for an explanation in the House
of Lords, when Brougham made a speech, and a very lame
one. He said he ordered his coachman to go back, who did
not hear him and went on, and when he had got through he
thought it was not worth while to turn back. The Lords
laughed. A few days after he drove over the soldiers in
Downing Street, who were relieving guard; but this time he
did no great harm to the men, and it was not his fault, but
these things are talked of.</p>

<p>Dined yesterday with General Macdonald to meet the
Kembles. Miss Fanny is near being very handsome from
the extraordinary expression of her countenance and fine
eyes, but her figure is not good. She is short, hands and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
feet large, arms handsome, skin dark and coarse, and her
manner wants ease and repose. Her mother is a very agreeable
woman. I did not sit next to Fanny, and had no talk
with her afterwards.</p>

<h3>March 18th, 1831</h3>

<p>Met Robert Clive yesterday morning; very
low about the Bill, which he thinks so sure to be carried
that he questions the expediency of dividing on the second
reading; complained bitterly of the bad tactics and want of
union of the party, and especially of Peel&rsquo;s inactivity and
backwardness in not having rallied and taken the lead more
than he has; he is in fact so cold, phlegmatic, and calculating
that he disgusts those who can&rsquo;t do without him as a
leader; he will always have political but never personal
influence.</p>

<h3>March 20th, 1831</h3>

<p>On Friday night, after not a long but an
angry and noisy debate, there was a division on the timber
duties, and Government was beaten by forty-three, all the
Saints, West Indians, and anti-Free-traders voting with the
great body of Opposition. Their satisfaction was tumultuous.
They have long been desirous of bringing Ministers to a trial
of strength, and they did not care much upon what; they
wanted to let the world see the weakness of Government,
and besides on this occasion they hoped that a defeat might
be prejudicial to the Reform Bill, so that this matter of commercial
and fiscal policy is not decided on its own merits, but
is influenced by passion, violence, party tactics, and its
remote bearing upon another question with which it has no
immediate relation. Althorp was obliged to abandon his
original proposition of taking off 5<i>s</i>. from the duty on Baltic
timber, which is 55<i>s</i>. (and 45<i>s</i>. on deals), and adding 10<i>s</i>. to
the Canadian, which is already 10<i>s</i>. He proposed instead to
take off 6<i>s</i>. from the former this year, 6<i>s</i>. next, and 3<i>s</i>. next,
so as to give plenty of time for the withdrawal of capital,
and to meet all contingencies. The proposal was not unfair,
and in other times would have been carried. Poulett Thomson
made a very good speech, clear and satisfactory. Peel
was what is called very factious&mdash;that is, in opposition&mdash;just
what the others were, violent and unreasonable as far as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE REFORM BILL.</span>
question is concerned, but acting upon a system having for
its object to embarrass the Government.</p>

<p>I still think the second reading of the Reform Bill will
pass, and, all things considered, that it would be the best
thing that could happen; it is better to capitulate than
to be taken by storm. The people are unanimous, good-humoured,
and determined; if the Bill is thrown out, their
good humour will disappear, the country will be a scene of
violence and uproar, and a most ferocious Parliament will
be returned, which will not only carry the question of
Reform, but possibly do so in a very different form. We
should see the <i>iræ leonum vincla recusantûm</i>, and this proposition
is so evident, this state of things is so indisputable,
that it is marvellous to me how anybody can triumph and
exult in the anticipation of a victory the consequences of
which would be more unfortunate than a defeat. If indeed
a victory could set the matter at rest, confirm our present institutions,
and pacify the people, it would be very well; but
Reform the people will have, and no human power, moral or
physical, can now arrest its career. It would be better, then,
to concede with a good grace, and to modify the measure in
Committee, which may still be practicable, than to oppose
it point blank without a prospect of success.</p>

<h3>March 22nd, 1831</h3>

<p>The debate began again last night, and was
adjourned. It was dull, and the House impatient. To-night
they will divide, and after a thousand fluctuations of opinion
it is thought the Bill will be thrown out by a small majority.
Then will come the question of a dissolution, which one side
affirms will take place directly, and the other that the King
will not consent to it, knowing, as &lsquo;the man in the street&rsquo; (as
we call him at Newmarket) always does, the greatest secrets
of kings, and being the confidant of their most hidden
thoughts. As for me, I see nothing but a choice of difficulties
either way, and victory or defeat would be equally bad.
It is odd enough, but I believe Lord Lansdowne thinks just
the same, for he asked me yesterday morning what I expected
would be the result, and I told him my opinion on the whole
question, and he replied, &lsquo;I can add nothing to what you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
have said; that is exactly my own opinion,&rsquo; and I have very
little doubt that more than half the Cabinet in their hearts
abhor the measure. Knatchbull was taken ill in the morning,
and could not go to the House at all.</p>

<h3>March 23rd, 1831</h3>

<p>The House divided at three o&rsquo;clock this
morning, and the second reading was carried by a majority
of <i>one</i> in the fullest House that ever was known&mdash;303 to 302&mdash;both
parties confident up to the moment of division; but the
Opposition most so, and at last the Government expected to
be beaten. Denman told somebody as they were going to
divide that the question would be lost; Calcraft and the
Wynnes&rsquo; going over at the eleventh hour did the business.
I believe that this division is the best thing that could
happen, and so I told the Duke in the morning, and that I
had wished it to be carried by a small majority; I met him
walking with Arbuthnot in the Park. He said, &lsquo;I could not
take such a course&rsquo; (that was in answer to my saying I
wished it to be read a second time, to be lost in the Committee).
I said, &lsquo;But you would have nothing to do with it
personally.&rsquo; &lsquo;No; but as belonging to the party I could not
recommend such a course,&rsquo; which seemed as if he did not
altogether disagree with my view of it. I stopped at the
&lsquo;Travellers&rsquo; till past three, when a man came in and told me
the news. I walked home, and found the streets swarming
with members of Parliament coming from the House. My
belief is (if they manage well and are active and determined)
that the Bill will be lost in Committee, and then this will be
the best thing that could have occurred.</p>

<h3>March 24th, 1831</h3>

<p>The agitation the other night on the division
was prodigious. The Government, who stayed in the
House, thought they had lost it by ten, and the Opposition,
who were crowded in the lobby, fancied from their numbers
that they were sure of winning. There was betting going on
all night long, and large sums have been won and lost. The
people in the lobby were miscounted, and they thought they
had 303. At the levee yesterday and Council; the Government
are by way of being satisfied, but hardly can be. I met
the Duke of Wellington afterwards, who owned to me that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">REFORM BILL CARRIED BY ONE VOTE. </span>
thought this small majority for the Bill was on the whole the
best thing that could have occurred, and that seems to be the
opinion generally of its opponents.</p>

<p>Nothing particularly at the levee; Brougham very good
fun. The King, who had put off going to the Opera on
account of the death of his son-in-law Kennedy, appeared in
mourning (crape, that is), which is reckoned bad taste; the
public allow natural feeling to supersede law and etiquette,
but it is too much to extend that courtesy to a &lsquo;son-in-law,&rsquo;
and his daughter is not in England. Somebody said that
&lsquo;it was the first time a King of England had appeared in
mourning that his subjects did not wear.&rsquo; In the evening to
the Ancient Concert, where the Queen was, and by-the-bye
in mourning, and the Margravine and Duchess of Gloucester
too, but they (the two latter) could hardly be mourning for
Lord Cassilis&rsquo;s son. Horace Seymour, Meynell, and Calvert
were all turned out of their places in the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s
department on account of their votes the other night.</p>

<p>The change of Ministers at Paris and Casimir Périer&rsquo;s
speech have restored something like confidence about French
affairs. The Prince of Orange is gone back to Holland, to his
infinite disgust; he was escorted by Lady Dudley Stewart
and Mrs. Fox as far as Gravesend, I believe, where they were
found the next day in their white satin shoes and evening
dresses. He made a great fool of himself here, and destroyed
any sympathy there might have been for his political misfortunes;
supping, dancing, and acting, and little (rather
innocent) orgies at these ladies&rsquo; houses formed his habitual
occupation.</p>

<p>A sort of repose from the cursed Bill for a moment, but
it is said that many who opposed it before are going to support
it in Committee; nobody knows. When the Speaker
put the question, each party roared &lsquo;Aye&rsquo; and &lsquo;No&rsquo; <i>totis
viribus</i>. He said he did not know, and put it again. After
that he said, &lsquo;I am not sure, but I think the ayes have it.&rsquo;
Then the noes went out into the lobby, and the others thought
they never would have done filing out, and the House looked
so empty when they were gone that the Government was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
despair. They say the excitement was beyond anything. I
continue to hear great complaints of Peel&mdash;of his coldness,
incommunicativeness, and deficiency in all the qualities
requisite for a leader, particularly at such a time. There is
nobody else, or he would be deserted for any man who had
talents enough to take a prominent part, so much does he
disgust his adherents. Nobody knows what are his
opinions, feelings, wishes, or intentions; he will not go <i>en
avant</i>, and nobody feels any dependence upon him. There is
no help for it and the man&rsquo;s nature can&rsquo;t be altered. I said
all this to Ross yesterday, his devoted adherent, and he was
obliged to own it, with all kinds of regrets and endeavours to
soften the picture.</p>

<h3>April 14th, 1831</h3>

<p>The Reform campaign has reopened with a
violent speech from Hunt denouncing the whole thing as a
delusion; that the people begin to find out how they are
humbugged, and that as it will make nothing cheaper they
don&rsquo;t care about it. The man&rsquo;s drift is not very clear
whether the Bill is really unpalatable at Preston or whether
he wants to go further directly. At the same time John
Russell announced some alterations in the Bill, not, as he
asserted, trenching upon its principle, but, as the Opposition
declares, altering it altogether. On the whole, these things
have inspirited its opponents, and, as they must produce
delay, are in so far bad for the Reform cause. Besides,
though the opinion of the country is universally in its favour,
people are beginning to think that it may be rejected without
any apprehension of such dreadful consequences ensuing as
have been predicted. Then the state of Ireland is such that
it is thought the Ministers cannot encounter a dissolution,
not that I feel any security on that head, for I believe the
Cabinet is ruled by two or three men reckless of everything
provided they can prolong their own power.</p>

<h3>April 24th, 1831</h3>

<p>At Newmarket all last week, and returned
to town last night to hear from those who saw them the extraordinary
scenes in both Houses of Parliament (the day before)
which closed the eventful week. The Reform battle began
again on Monday last. The night before I went out of town
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEFEAT AND DISSOLUTION.</span>
I met Duncannon, and walked with him up Regent Street,
when he told me that he did not believe the Ministers would
be beaten, but if they were they should certainly dissolve
instantly; that <i>he</i> should have liked to dissolve long ago,
but they owed it to their friends not to have recourse to a
dissolution if they could help it. On Monday General
Gascoyne moved that the Committee should be instructed
not to reduce the members of the House of Commons, and
this was carried after two nights&rsquo; debate by eight. The dissolution
was then decided upon. Meanwhile Lord Wharncliffe
gave notice of a motion to address the King not to
dissolve Parliament, and this was to have come on on Friday.
On Thursday the Ministers were again beaten in the House
of Commons on a question of adjournment, and on Friday
morning they got the King to go down and prorogue Parliament
in person the same day. This <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> was so
sudden that nobody was aware of it till within two or three
hours of the time, and many not at all. They told him that
the cream-coloured horses could not be got ready, when he
said, &lsquo;Then I will go with anybody else&rsquo;s horses.&rsquo; Somebody
went off in a carriage to the Tower, to fetch the Crown, and
they collected such attendants as they could find to go with
his Majesty. The Houses met at one or two o&rsquo;clock. In the
House of Commons Sir R. Vyvyan made a furious speech,
attacking the Government on every point, and (excited as he
was) it was very well done. The Ministers made no reply,
but Sir Francis Burdett and Tennyson endeavoured to interrupt
with calls to order, and when the Speaker decided that
Vyvyan was not out of order Tennyson disputed his opinion,
which enraged the Speaker, and soon after called up Peel,
for whom he was resolved to procure a hearing. The scene
then resembled that which took place on Lord North&rsquo;s
resignation in 1782, for Althorp (I think) moved that Burdett
should be heard, and the Speaker said that &lsquo;Peel was in
possession of the House to speak on that motion.&rsquo; He made
a very violent speech, attacking the Government for their
incompetence, folly, and recklessness, and treated them with
the utmost asperity and contempt. In the midst of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
speech the guns announced the arrival of the King, and at
each explosion the Government gave a loud cheer, and Peel
was still speaking in the midst of every sort of noise and
tumult when the Usher of the Black Rod knocked at the door
to summon the Commons to the House of Peers. There
the proceedings were if possible still more violent and outrageous;
those who were present tell me it resembled
nothing but what we read of the &lsquo;Serment du Jeu de Paume,&rsquo;
and the whole scene was as much like the preparatory days
of a revolution as can well be imagined. Wharncliffe was
to have moved an address to the Crown against dissolving
Parliament, and this motion the Ministers were resolved
should not come on, but he contrived to bring it on so far as
to get it put upon the Journals. The Duke of Richmond
endeavoured to prevent any speaking by raising points of
order, and moving that the Lords should take their regular
places (in separate ranks), which, however, is impossible at
a royal sitting, because the cross benches are removed; this
put Lord Londonderry in such a fury that he rose, roared,
gesticulated, held up his whip, and four or five Lords held
him down by the tail of his coat to prevent his flying on
somebody. Lord Lyndhurst was equally furious, and some
sharp words passed which were not distinctly heard. In the
midst of all the din Lord Mansfield rose and obtained a
hearing. Wharncliffe said to him, &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Mansfield,
take care what you are about, and don&rsquo;t disgrace us
more in the state we are in.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;I
will say nothing that will alarm you;&rsquo; and accordingly he
pronounced a trimming philippic on the Government, which,
delivered as it was in an imposing manner, attired in his
robes, and with the greatest energy and excitation, was prodigiously
effective. While he was still speaking, the King
arrived, but he did not desist even while his
Majesty<a name="FNA_14_01" id="FNA_14_01"></a><a href="#FN_14_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING DISSOLVES PARLIAMENT.</span>
entering the House of Lords, nor till he approached the
throne; and while the King was ascending the steps, the
hoarse voice of Lord Londonderry was heard crying &lsquo;Hear,
hear, hear!&rsquo; The King from the robing-room heard the
noise, and asked what it all meant. The conduct of the
Chancellor was most extraordinary, skipping in and out of
the House and making most extraordinary speeches. In
the midst of the uproar he went out of the House, when
Lord Shaftesbury was moved into the chair. In the middle
of the debate Brougham again came in and said, &lsquo;it was
most extraordinary that the King&rsquo;s undoubted right to dissolve
Parliament should be questioned at a moment when
the House of Commons had taken the unprecedented course
of stopping the supplies,&rsquo; and having so said (which was a
lie) he flounced out of the House to receive the King on his arrival.
The King ought not properly to have worn the
Crown, never having been crowned; but when he was in the
robing-room he said to Lord Hastings, &lsquo;Lord Hastings, I
wear the Crown; where is it?&rsquo; It was brought to him, and
when Lord Hastings was going to put it on his head he said,
&lsquo;Nobody shall put the Crown on my head but myself.&rsquo; He
put it on, and then turned to Lord Grey and said, &lsquo;Now, my
Lord, the coronation is over.&rsquo; George Villiers said that in
his life he never saw such a scene, and as he looked at the
King upon the throne with the Crown loose upon his head,
and the tall, grim figure of Lord Grey close beside him with
the sword of state in his hand, it was as if the King had
got his executioner by his side, and the whole picture looked
strikingly typical of his and our future destinies.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_14_01" id="FN_14_01"></a><a href="#FNA_14_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
When Lord Mansfield sat down he said, &lsquo;I have spoken English to
them at least.&rsquo; Lord Lyndhurst told me that Lord Mansfield stopped
speaking as soon as the door opened to admit the King. He said he never
saw him so excited before, and in his robes he looked very grand. He also
told me that he was at Lady Holland&rsquo;s giving an account of the scene
when Brougham came in. He said, &lsquo;I was telling them what passed the
other day in our House,&rsquo; when Brougham explained his part by saying that
the Usher of the Black Rod (Tyrwhit) was at his elbow saying, &lsquo;My Lord
Chancellor, you must come; the King is waiting for you: come along; you
must come,&rsquo; and that he was thus dragged out of the House in this hurry
and without having time to sit down or say any more.</p></div>

<p>Such has been the termination of this Parliament and of
the first act of the new Ministerial drama; there never was
a Government ousted with more ignominy than the last, nor
a Ministry that came in with higher pretensions, greater
professions, and better prospects than the present, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
nothing ever corresponded less than their performances
with their pretensions. The composition of the Government
was radically defective, and with a good deal of loose talent
there was so much of passion, folly, violence, and knavery,
together with inexperience and ignorance mixed up with it,
that from the very beginning they cut the sorriest possible
figure. Such men as Richmond, Durham, Althorp, and
Graham, in their different ways, were enough to spoil any
Cabinet, and consequently their course has been marked by
a series of blunders and defeats. Up to the moment of the
dissolution few people expected it would happen, some
thinking the King would not consent, others that the
Government would never venture upon it, but the King is
weak and the Ministry reckless. That disposition, which at
first appeared so laudable, of putting himself implicitly into
the hands of his Ministers, and which seemed the more so
from the contrast it afforded to the conduct of the late King,
who was always thwarting his Ministers, throwing difficulties
in their way, and playing a double part, becomes
vicious when carried to the extent of paralysing all free
action and free opinion on his part, and of suffering himself
to be made the instrument of any measures, however violent.
It may be said, indeed, that he cordially agrees with these
men, and has opinions coincident with theirs, but this is not
probable; and when we remember his unlimited confidence in
the Duke up to the moment of his resignation, it is impossible
to believe that he can have so rapidly imbibed principles the
very reverse of those which the Duke
maintained.<a name="FNA_14_02" id="FNA_14_02"></a><a href="#FN_14_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
It is more likely that he has no opinions, and is really a mere
puppet in the hands into which he may happen to fall. Lord
Mansfield had an audience, and gave him his sentiments
upon the state of affairs. He will not say what passed
between them, but it is clear that it was of no use.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_14_02" id="FN_14_02"></a><a href="#FNA_14_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
The King was extremely opposed to the dissolution, and had remonstrated
against it ever since it was first proposed to him in March. See
Lord Grey&rsquo;s letter in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; of March 26, 1866.</p></div>

<p>The Queen and the Royal Family are extremely unhappy
at all these things, but the former has no influence whatever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE GENERAL ELECTION.</span>
with the King. In the meantime there are very different
opinions as to the result of the elections, some thinking that
Government will not gain much by the dissolution, others
that they (or at least Reform) will win everything. It seems
to me quite impossible that they should not win everything,
but time is gained to the other side. The census of 1831 will
be out, and the chapter of accidents may and must make much
difference; still I see no possibility of arresting the progress
of Reform, and whether this Bill or another like it passes is
much the same thing. The Government have made it up
with O&rsquo;Connell, which is one mouthful of the dirty pudding
they have had to swallow, as one of their own friends said of
them.</p>

<h3>April 26th, 1831</h3>

<p>Last night at the Queen&rsquo;s ball; heaps of
people of all sorts; everybody talking of the elections. Both
parties pretend to be confident, but the Government with
the best reason. The county members, as Sefton says, are
tumbling about like nine-pins, and though it seems not
improbable that the Opposition will gain in the boroughs,
they must lose greatly in the counties; and we must not
only look to the relative numbers, but to the composition of
the respective parties. A large minority composed of borough
nominees, corporation members, and only a sprinkling of
what is called independence would not look well. Large
sums have been subscribed on both sides, but on that of the
Opposition there is a want of candidates more than of places
to send them to.</p>

<p>I met Lyndhurst last night, and asked him what it was
he said in the House of Lords. He said it was nothing very
violent, but that it was not heard. The Duke of Richmond
had spoken to the point of order, and said in a very marked
way &lsquo;he saw a noble Earl sitting by a <i>junior</i> Baron.&rsquo; This
was Lyndhurst, who was offended at the sneer upon his want
of <i>ancienneté</i>, and who retorted that before the noble Duke
made such speeches on points of order he would do well to
make himself acquainted with the orders of the House, of
which it was obvious he knew nothing. The Duke of Devonshire
told Lady Lyndhurst that her husband ought to resign
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
his judicial situation because he had displayed hostility to
Government the other night, but it would be a new maxim
to establish that the judges were to be amenable to the
Minister for their political opinions and Parliamentary conduct.</p>

<h3>April 29th, 1831</h3>

<p>The night before last there was an illumination,
got up by the foolish Lord Mayor, which of course
produced an uproar and a general breaking of obnoxious
windows. Lord Mansfield and the Duke of Buccleuch went
to Melbourne in the morning and remonstrated, asking what
protection he meant to afford to their properties. A gun
(with powder only) was fired over the heads of the mob from
Apsley House, and they did not go there again. The Government
might have discouraged this manifestation of triumph,
but they wished for it for the purpose of increasing the
popular excitement. They don&rsquo;t care what they do, or what
others do, so long as they can keep the people in a ferment.
It is disgusting to the last degree to hear their joy and exultation
at the success of their measures and the good prospects
held out to them by the elections; all of which may
turn out very well, but if it does not &lsquo;who shall set hoddy-doddy
up again?&rsquo; Lord Cleveland has subscribed 10,000&#8467;. to
the election fund.</p>

<p>Lord Yarborough, by a very questionable piece of political
morality, has given the Holmes boroughs in the Isle of Wight
to Government; they are the property of Sir L. Holmes&rsquo;s
daughter, whose guardian he is as well as executor under
the will. In this capacity he has the disposal of the boroughs,
and he gives them to the Ministers to fill with men who are
to vote for their disfranchisement. A large price is paid for
them&mdash;4,000&#8467;.&mdash;but it makes a difference of eight votes, and if
the Bill is carried they will be worth nothing. The elections
promise well for Government even in the boroughs, as I was
persuaded they would. O&rsquo;Connell has put forth a proclamation
entreating, commanding peace, order, and support of the
Bill&rsquo;s supporters. Tom Moore called on me yesterday morning.
He said that he was a Reformer and liked the Bill, but he
was fully aware of all that it might produce of evil to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE QUEEN ALARMED IN THE CITY.</span>
present system. He owned frankly that he felt like an Irishman
and that the wrongs of Ireland and the obstinacy of
the faction who had oppressed her still rankled in his heart,
and that he should not be sorry at any vengeance which
might overtake them at last. I hear renewed complaints of
Peel, of his selfish, cold, calculating, cowardly policy; that
we are indebted to him principally for our present condition
I have no doubt&mdash;to his obstinacy and to his conduct in the
Catholic question first, to his opposition and then to his support
of it. Opposing all and every sort of Reform <i>totis viribus</i>
while he dared, now he makes a death-bed profession of
acquiescence in something which should be more moderate
than this. All these things disgust people inconceivably, and
it is not the less melancholy that he is our only resource, and
his capacity for business and power in the House of Commons
places him so far above all his competitors that if we
are to have a Conservative party we must look to him alone
to lead it.</p>

<h3>May 7th, 1831</h3>

<p>Nothing could go on worse than the elections&mdash;Reformers
returned everywhere, so much so that the
contest is over, and we have only to await the event and
see what the House of Lords will do. In the House of
Commons the Bill is already carried. It is supposed that the
Ministers themselves begin to be alarmed at the devil they
have let loose, and well they may; but he is out, and stop
him who can. The King has put off his visit to the City
because he is ill, as the Government would have it believed,
but really because he is furious with the Lord Mayor at all
the riots and uproar on the night of the illumination. That
night the Queen went to the Ancient Concert, and on her
return the mob surrounded the carriage; she had no guards,
and the footmen were obliged to beat the people off with
their canes to prevent their thrusting their heads into the
coach. She was frightened and the King very much annoyed.
He heard the noise and tumult, and paced backwards and
forwards in his room waiting for her return. When she
came back Lord Howe, her chamberlain, as usual preceded
her, when the King said, &lsquo;How is the Queen?&rsquo; and went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
down to meet her. Howe, who is an eager anti-Reformer,
said, &lsquo;Very much frightened, sir,&rsquo; and made the worst of it.
She was in fact terrified, and as she detests the whole of
these proceedings, the more distressed and disgusted. The
King was very angry and immediately declared he would
not go to the City at all. It is supposed that Government
will make a large batch of Peers to secure the Bill in the
House of Lords, but the press have already begun to attack
that House, declaring that if they pass the Bill it will be
from compulsion, and if they do not that they are the enemies
of the people.</p>

<h3>May 11th, 1831</h3>

<p>The elections are going on universally in
favour of Reform; the great interests in the counties are
everywhere broken, and old connexions dissevered. In Worcestershire
Captain Spencer, who has nothing to do with the
county, and was brought there by his brother-in-law, Lord
Lyttelton, has beaten Lygon, backed by all the wealth of his
family; the Manners have withdrawn from Leicestershire and
Cambridgeshire, and Lord E. Somerset from Gloucestershire;
Lord Worcester too is beaten at Monmouth. Everywhere
the tide is irresistible; all considerations are sacrificed
to the success of the measure. At the last Essex election
Colonel Tyrrell saved Western, who would have been beaten
by Long Wellesley, and now Western has coalesced with Wellesley
against Tyrrell, and will throw him out. In Northamptonshire
Althorp had pledged himself to Cartwright not
to bring forward another candidate on his side, and Milton
joins him and stands. The state of excitement, doubt, and
apprehension which prevails will not quickly subside, for the
battle is only beginning; when the Bill is carried we must
prepare for the second act.</p>

<h3>May 14th, 1831</h3>

<p>The elections are still going for Reform. They
count upon a majority of 140 in the House of Commons, but
the Tories meditate resistance in the House of Lords, which
it is to be hoped will be fruitless, and it is probable the Peers
will trot round as they did about the Catholic question when
it comes to the point. There is a great hubbub at Northampton
about a pledge which Althorp is supposed to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD MUNSTER&rsquo;S PEERAGE.</span>
given not to bring forward another candidate against Cartwright
which the anti-Reformers say he has violated in
putting up Milton, and moreover that such conduct is very
dishonest; and as his honesty was his principal recommendation,
if he should have forfeited that what would remain to
him? On the contrary his friends say that he gave no such
pledge, that he expressed a hope there might be no contest,
but the people would have Milton, and though Althorp regretted
his standing, as he did stand they were obliged to
join for their common safety. So much for this electioneering
squabble, of which time will elicit the truth. Last night I
went to Prince Leopold&rsquo;s, where was George Fitzclarence
receiving congratulations on his new dignity (Earl of
Munster). He told me everybody had been very kind about
it&mdash;the King, Lord Grey, his friends, and the public. He had
told Lord Grey he was anxious his brothers and sisters
should have the rank of marquis&rsquo;s sons and daughters (to
give them titles). Grey had only objected that their titles
would then represent a higher rank than his
own,<a name="FNA_14_03" id="FNA_14_03"></a><a href="#FN_14_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
but that
he laid no stress on that objection, and it would be done
directly. Melbourne has written a letter to the Lord Mayor
assuring him that ill health is the only obstacle to the King&rsquo;s
visit to the City, and that there is no foundation for the
report of his displeasure, the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s explanation
having proved quite satisfactory. This is not true, I believe,
but they make him say so.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_14_03" id="FN_14_03"></a><a href="#FNA_14_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[If Lord Grey said this it was a mistake. The younger sons and
daughters of marquises take rank after earls.]</p></div>

<h3>May 22nd, 1831</h3>

<p>At Epsom all last week for the races at a
house which Lord Chesterfield took; nobody there but the
three
sisters<a name="FNA_14_04" id="FNA_14_04"></a><a href="#FN_14_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
and their two husbands. Rode out on the downs
every morning, and enjoyed the fine country, as beautiful as
any I have seen of the kind. After the races on Friday
I went to Richmond to dine with Lord and Lady Lyndhurst,
and was refreshed by his vigorous mind after the three or
four days I had passed. He thinks the state of things very
bad, has a great contempt for this Government, is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
doubtful what will happen, thinks Lord Grey will not stand,
and that Brougham will be Chancellor and Prime Minister,
like Clarendon; he talked of the late Government, the Duke
of Wellington and Peel; he said that the former meddled
with no department but that of Foreign Affairs, which he
conducted entirely; that he understood them better than
anything else, and if he came into office again would be
Foreign Secretary; that in the Cabinet he was always candid,
reasonable, and ready to discuss fairly every subject, but
not so Peel. He, if his opinion was not adopted, would take
up a newspaper and sulk. Lyndhurst agreed with me about
his manners, his coldness, and how he disgusted instead of
conciliating people; he said that when any of his friends in
Parliament proposed to speak in any debate, he never encouraged
or assisted them, but answered with a dry &lsquo;Do you?&rsquo;
to their notification of a wish or intention. He said that this
Bill was drawn up by Lambton himself, but so ill done, so
ignorantly and inefficiently, that they were obliged to send
for Harrison, who, in conjunction with the Attorney-General,
drew it up afresh; that when John Russell brought it forward
the Bill was still
undrawn.<a name="FNA_14_05" id="FNA_14_05"></a><a href="#FN_14_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
He says that there is not
the least doubt they never had an idea of bringing forward
any such measure as this till they found themselves so weak
in the House of Commons that nothing but a popular cry and
Radical support could possibly save them. It is very remarkable
when we look back to the moment of the dissolution of
the late Government, when Brougham was in the House of
Commons armed with his Bill, which, though unknown, was
so dreaded, and which turns out to have been mere milk and
water compared with this. He said Brougham was offered
the Attorney-Generalship by a note, which he tore in pieces
and stamped upon, and sent word that there was no answer;
that he has long aspired to be Chancellor, and wished to get
into the House of Lords. He ridicules his pretensions to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM AS A JUDGE.</span>
such wonderful doings in his Court and in the Bills he has announced;
says that he has decided no bankruptcy cases, and,
except some Scotch appeals in the House of Lords, has got
rid of hardly any arrears; and as to his Bills, the Bankruptcy
Bill was objectionable and the Chancery Bill he has
never brought on at all; that he knows he affects a short cut
to judicial eminence, but that without labour and reading
he cannot administer justice in that Court, although no
doubt his great acuteness and rapid perception may often
enable him at once to see the merits of a case and hit upon
the important points. This he said in reply to what I
told him of Brougham&rsquo;s trumpeter Sefton, who echoes from
his own lips that &lsquo;the Court of Chancery is such a sinecure
and mere child&rsquo;s play.&rsquo;</p>

[Compare the details of the preparation of the Reform Bill published
by Lord Russell in the last edition of his &lsquo;Essay on the British Constitution.&rsquo;
Much of this conversation of Lord Lyndhurst&rsquo;s is extremely wide of the
truth, but it is retained to show what was said and believed by competent
persons at the time.]</p></div>

<p>In the meantime the elections have been going languidly
on, and are now nearly over; contrary to the prognostications
of the Tories, they have gone off very quietly, even in Ireland
not many contests, the anti-Reformers being unable to
make any fight at all; except in Shropshire they are dead-beat
everywhere. Northamptonshire the sharpest contest,
and the one which has made the most ill blood; this particular
election has produced a good deal of violence; elsewhere
the Reformers have it hollow, no matter what the
characters of the candidates, if they are only for the Bill.
Calcraft and Wellesley, the former not respected, the latter
covered with disgrace, have beat Bankes and Tyrrell. Lowther
had not a chance in Cumberland, where Sir James
Graham got into another scrape, for in an impertinent speech
he made an attack upon Scarlett, which drew upon him a
message and from him an apology. Formerly, when a man
made use of offensive expressions and was called to account,
he thought it right to go out and stand a shot before he ate
his words, but now-a-days that piece of chivalry is dispensed
with, and politicians make nothing of being scurrilous one
day and humble the next. Hyde Villiers has been appointed
to succeed Sandon at the Board of Control as a Whig and a
Reformer. He was in a hundred minds what line he should
take, and had written a pamphlet to prove the necessity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
giving Ministers seats in both Houses (as in France), which
he has probably put in the fire. I am very glad he has got
the place, and though his opinions were not very decided
before, he has always been anti-Tory, and has done nothing
discreditable to get it, and it was offered to him in a very
flattering manner.</p>

<h3>May 28th, 1831</h3>

<p>Yesterday Lord Grey was invested with the
blue ribband, though there is no vacancy; the only precedent
is that of Lords Liverpool and Castlereagh (which was
thought wrong), but it was on the occasion of the peace
after Bonaparte&rsquo;s overthrow and when Castlereagh returned
with such <i>éclat</i> from Paris that the whole House of Commons
rose and cheered him as he entered it.</p>

<p>I met Alexander Baring the other night, who said it was
certain that the King was full of regrets at the extent of the
measures into which he had been hurried, when I told him
of Lord Grey&rsquo;s Garter, and asked him what he said to that,
and how that bore out the assertion of the King&rsquo;s regrets.
The fact is that although on one side a most indecent though
effectual use of the King&rsquo;s name has been made, on the other
there is nothing that is not asserted with equal confidence
about &lsquo;his difficulties and his scruples.&rsquo; Sefton told me that
it was the sort of things that were said that made the King
write to Lord Grey (he saw the letter) and tell him that he
thought it of the greatest importance at the present moment
to confer upon him a signal mark of his regard and of his
satisfaction with the whole of his conduct. It is, I believe,
true that the King felt some alarm and some doubt about
the dissolution, but I do not believe that he has any doubts
or fears at present. Indeed, how should he not have suffered
himself to be led away by these people and to become identified
with their measure? They have given him an ample
share of the praise of it; they assure him it will be eminently
successful; he sees himself popular and applauded to the
skies, and as far as things have gone it has been successful,
for the elections have gone on and gone off very peaceably,
and the country in expectation of the passing of the Bill is
in a state of profound tranquillity.</p>


<h3>June 5th, 1831</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING AT ASCOT.</span>
All last week at Fern Hill for the Ascot races;
the Chesterfields, Tavistocks, Belfasts, George Ansons, Montague,
Stradbroke, and Brooke Greville were there. The Royal
Family came to the course the first day with a great <i>cortége</i>&mdash;eight
coaches and four, two phaetons, pony sociables, and
led horses&mdash;Munster riding on horseback behind the King&rsquo;s
carriage, Augustus (the parson) and Frederick driving phaetons.
The Duke of Richmond was in the King&rsquo;s calèche
and Lord Grey in one of the coaches. The reception was
strikingly cold and indifferent, not half so good as that
which the late King used to receive. William was bored
to death with the races, and his own horse broke down. On
Wednesday he did not come; on Thursday they came again.
Beautiful weather and unprecedented multitudes. The King
was much more cheered than the first day, or the greater
number of people made a greater noise. A few cheers were
given to Lord Grey as he returned, which he just acknowledged
and no more. On Friday we dined at the Castle;
each day the King asked a crowd of people from the neighbourhood.
We arrived at a little before seven; the Queen
was only just come in from riding, so we had to wait till
near eight. Above forty people at dinner, for which the
room is not nearly large enough; the dinner was not bad,
but the room insufferably hot. The Queen was taken
out by the Duke of Richmond, and the King followed
with the Duchess of Saxe Weimar, the Queen&rsquo;s sister. He
drinks wine with everybody, asking seven or eight at a time.
After dinner he drops asleep. We sat for a short time.
Directly after coffee the band began to play; a good band,
not numerous, and principally of violins and stringed instruments.
The Queen and the whole party sat there all the
evening, so that it was, in fact, a concert of instrumental
music. The King took Lady Tavistock to St. George&rsquo;s Hall
and the ball room, where we walked about, with two or three
servants carrying lamps to show the proportions, for it was
not lit up. The whole thing is exceedingly magnificent, and
the manner of life does not appear to be very formal, and
need not be disagreeable but for the bore of never dining
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
without twenty strangers. The Castle holds very few people,
and with the King&rsquo;s and Queen&rsquo;s immediate suite and <i>toute la
bâtardise</i> it was quite full. The King&rsquo;s four sons were
there, <i>signoreggianti tutti</i>, and the whole thing &lsquo;donnait à
penser&rsquo; to those who looked back a little and had seen other
days. We sat in that room in which Lyndhurst has often
talked to me of the famous five hours&rsquo; discussion with the
late King, when the Catholic Bill hung upon his caprice.
Palmerston told me he had never been in the Castle since
the eventful day of Herries&rsquo; appointment and non-appointment;
and how many things have happened since. What a
<i>changement de décoration</i>; no longer George IV., capricious,
luxurious, and misanthropic, liking nothing but the society
of listeners and flatterers, with the Conyngham tribe and
one or two Tory Ministers and foreign Ambassadors; but a
plain, vulgar, hospitable gentleman, opening his doors to all
the world, with a numerous family and suite, a Whig
Ministry, no foreigners, and no toad-eaters at all. Nothing
can be more different, and looking at him one sees
how soon this act will be finished, and the same be changed
for another probably not less dissimilar. Queen, bastards,
Whigs,<a name="FNA_14_06" id="FNA_14_06"></a><a href="#FN_14_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
all will disappear, and God knows what replaces
them. Came to town yesterday, and found a quarrel between
Henry Bentinck and Sir Roger Gresley, which I had to
settle, and did settle amicably in the course of the evening.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_14_06" id="FN_14_06"></a><a href="#FNA_14_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
Not Whigs&mdash;they are <i>les bienvenus</i>, which they were not before.&mdash;<i>July

<h3>June 7th, 1831</h3>

<p>Dined with Sefton yesterday, who gave me an
account of a dinner at Fowell Buxton&rsquo;s on Saturday to see
the brewery, at which Brougham was the &lsquo;magnus Apollo.&rsquo;
Sefton is excellent as a commentator on Brougham; he says
that he watches him incessantly, never listens to anybody
else when he is there, and <i>rows</i> him unmercifully afterwards
for all the humbug, nonsense, and palaver he hears him talk
to people. They were twenty-seven at dinner. Talleyrand
was to have gone, but was frightened by being told that he
would get nothing but beefsteaks and porter, so he stayed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DINNER AT HANBURY&rsquo;S BREWERY.</span>
away. They dined in the brewhouse and visited the whole
establishment. Lord Grey was there in star, garter, and ribband.
There were people ready to show and explain everything,
but not a bit&mdash;Brougham took the explanation of
everything into his own hands&mdash;the mode of brewing, the
machinery, down to the feeding of the cart horses. After
dinner the account books were brought, and the young Buxtons
were beckoned up to the top of the table by their father
to hear the words of wisdom that flowed from the lips of my
Lord Chancellor. He affected to study the ledger, and made
various pertinent remarks on the manner of book-keeping.
There was a man whom Brougham called &lsquo;Cornelius&rsquo; (Sefton
did not know who he was) with whom he seemed very familiar.
While Brougham was talking he dropped his voice, on which
&lsquo;Cornelius&rsquo; said, &lsquo;Earl Grey is listening,&rsquo; that he might
speak louder and so nothing be lost. He was talking of
Paley, and said that &lsquo;although he did not always understand
his own meaning, he always contrived to make it intelligible
to others,&rsquo; on which &lsquo;Cornelius&rsquo; said, &lsquo;My good friend, if he
made it so clear to others he must have had some comprehension
of it himself;&rsquo; on which Sefton attacked him afterwards,
and swore that &lsquo;he was a mere child in the hands of
&ldquo;Cornelius,&rdquo;&rsquo; that &lsquo;he never saw anybody so put down.&rsquo;
These people are all subscribers to the London University,
and Sefton swears he overheard Brougham tell them
that &lsquo;Sir Isaac Newton was nothing compared to some of
the present professors,&rsquo; or something to that effect. I put
down all this nonsense because it amused me in the recital,
and is excessively characteristic of the man, one of the most
remarkable who ever existed. Lady Sefton told me that he
went with them to the British Museum, where all the officers
of the Museum were in attendance to receive them. He
would not let anybody explain anything, but did all the
honours himself. At last they came to the collection of
minerals, when she thought he must be brought to a standstill.
Their conductor began to describe them, when Brougham
took the words out of his mouth, and dashed off with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
as much ease and familiarity as if he had been a Buckland
or a Cuvier. Such is the man, a grand mixture of moral,
political, and intellectual incongruities.</p>

<h3>June 10th, 1831</h3>

<p>Breakfasted the day before yesterday with
Rogers, Sydney Smith, Luttrell, John Russell, and Moore;
excessively agreeable. I never heard anything more entertaining
than Sydney Smith; such bursts of merriment and
so dramatic. Breakfasts are the meals for poets. I met
Wordsworth and Southey at breakfast. Rogers&rsquo; are always
agreeable.</p>

<h3>June 15th, 1831</h3>

<p>Five new peerages came out yesterday&mdash;Sefton,
Kinnaird, Fingall, Leitrim, and Agar Ellis; John
Russell and Stanley are to be in the Cabinet. At the ball
at St. James&rsquo;s the other night George Dawson told me that
they had 270 people in the House of Commons on the side
of the Opposition, if they could command their attendance;
that he did not mean to say no Reform Bill would pass, but
that the details of this Bill had never yet been discussed,
and when they were it would be so clearly shown that it is
impracticable that this identical measure never could pass.
The Opposition are beginning to recover from their discouragement;
there is to be a meeting at Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s
on Friday, and they do, I believe, mean to fight it out.</p>

<h3>June 19th, 1831</h3>

<p>The last few days I have been completely
taken up with quarantine, and taking means to prevent the
cholera coming here. That disease made great ravages in
Russia last year, and in the winter the attention of Government
was called to it, and the question was raised whether
we should have to purify goods coming here in case it broke
out again, and if so how it was to be done. Government
was thinking of Reform and other matters, and would not
bestow much attention upon this subject, and accordingly
neither regulations nor preparations were made. All that
was done was to commission a Dr. Walker, a physician
residing at St. Petersburg, to go to Moscow and elsewhere
and make enquiries into the nature and progress of the
disease, and report the result of his investigation to us. He
turned out, however, to be a very useless and inefficient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CHOLERA.</span>
agent. In the meantime as the warm weather returned the
cholera again appeared in Russia, but still we took no further
measures until intelligence arrived that it had reached
Riga, at which place 700 or 800 sail of English vessels,
loaded principally with hemp and flax, were waiting to come
to this country. This report soon diffused a general alarm,
and for many days past the newspapers have been full of
letters and full of lies, and every sort of representation is
made to Government or through the press, as fear or interest
happen to dictate. The Consuls and Ministers abroad had
been for some time supplying us with such information as
they could obtain, so that we were in possession of a great
deal of documentary evidence regarding the nature, character,
and progress of the disease. The first thing we did
was to issue two successive Orders in Council placing all
vessels coming from the Baltic in quarantine, and we sent
for Sir Henry Halford and placed all the papers we had in
his hands, desiring that he would associate with himself
some other practitioners, and report their opinion as speedily
as possible whether the disease was contagious and whether
it could be conveyed by goods. They reported the next day
<i>yes</i> to the first question, <i>no</i> to the second. In 1804, on the
occasion of the yellow fever at Gibraltar, Government formed
a Board of Health, and took the opinion of the College of
Physicians, and it was intended to pursue the same course
in this instance, but Lords Lansdowne and Auckland chose
to take Halford&rsquo;s preliminary opinion, contrary to my advice,
for I foresaw that there would be a great embarrassment if
he and the College did not agree. Just so it turned out, for
when the case was submitted, with all the papers, to the
College, they would not adopt his opinion, much to his
annoyance, and, as I believe, because they did not like to be
merely called on to confirm what he had already said, and
that they thought their independence required a show of
dissent. The report they sent was very short and very
unsatisfactory, and entirely against all the evidence they
had before them; they advised precautionary measures. I
immediately wrote back an answer saying that their report
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was not satisfactory, and desiring a more detailed opinion,
and the reasons which had dictated their conclusion; but in
the meantime we set to work in earnest to adopt measures
against any emergency. The only way of performing quarantine
(with goods), it was found, would be by the employment
of men-of-war, and we accordingly asked the Admiralty
to supply ships for the purpose. This Lord Grey, Sir James
Graham, and Sir Byam Martin objected to, but Sir Thomas
Hardy and Captain Elliot did not. We proved that the ships
would sustain no injury, so after a battle they agreed to give
them. We made a variety of regulations, and gave strict
orders for the due performance of quarantine, and to-morrow
a proclamation is to be issued for constituting a Board of
Health and enjoining obedience to the quarantine laws, so
that everything has been done that can be done, and if the
cholera comes here it is not our fault. Most of the authorities
think it will come, but I doubt it. If indeed it is
wafted through the air it may, but I don&rsquo;t think it will if
it is only to be communicated by contact. All the evidence
proves that goods cannot convey it; nevertheless we have
placed merchandise under a discretionary quarantine, and
though we have not promulgated any general regulations, we
release no vessels that come from infected places, or that
have got enumerated goods on board. Poulett Thomson,
who is a trader as well as Privy Councillor, is very much
disgusted in his former capacity at the measures he is
obliged to concur in in his latter. This topic has now occupied
for some days a good deal of the attention even of
the fine fools of this town, and the Tories would even make
it a matter of party accusation against the Government,
only they don&rsquo;t know exactly how. It is always safe to deal
in generalities, so they say that &lsquo;Government ought to be
impeached if the disease comes here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There was a meeting of Peers to the amount of nearly
seventy at Lord Mansfield&rsquo;s the other day, which went off
greatly to their satisfaction. They unanimously agreed to
determine upon nothing in the way of amendment until they
had seen the King&rsquo;s Speech, to which, however, they will consider
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MEETING OF PEERS.</span>
themselves bound to move an amendment, provided it
contains anything laudatory of the Reform Bill. The Duke
of Wellington was not at the meeting, having been taken ill.
I met him the day before at dinner, and had a good deal of
conversation with him. He is in pretty good spirits, and
thinks they may make a good fight of it yet; told me that
Lyndhurst would certainly go thoroughly with them, praised
him largely, said he was the best colleague that any man
ever had, and that he should be very sorry ever to go into
any Cabinet of which he was not a member. The King
dined with the Duke yesterday, and was to give him a very
fine sword. Aubin, who was to have acted in &lsquo;Hernani&rsquo; before
the Queen on Wednesday next, is suddenly gone off to Rome
as <i>attaché</i> to Brook Taylor, who is there negotiating.
Taylor happened to be in Italy, and they sent him there,
some doubts existing whether they could by law send a
diplomatic agent to negotiate with the Pope; but it was
referred to Denman, who said there was no danger. He is
not accredited, and bears no <i>official</i> character, but it is a
regular mission. Lord Lansdowne told me that Leopold is
inconceivably anxious to be King of Belgium, that short of
going in direct opposition to the wishes and advice of all the
Royal Family and of the Government he would do anything
to be beking&rsquo;d, and, what is equally absurd, that the
others cannot bear that he should be thus elevated.</p>

<h3>June 23rd, 1831</h3>

<p>The King opened Parliament on Tuesday,
with a greater crowd assembled to see him pass than was
ever congregated before, and the House of Lords was so full
of ladies that the Peers could not find places. The Speech
was long, but good, and such as to preclude the possibility
of an amendment. There was, however, a long discussion
in each House, and the greatest bitterness and violence
evinced in both&mdash;every promise of a stormy session. Lord
Lansdowne said to the King, &lsquo;I am afraid, sir, you won&rsquo;t be
able to <i>see</i> the Commons.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;they shall
<i>hear</i> me, I promise you,&rsquo; and accordingly he thundered forth
the Speech so that not a word was lost.</p>

<p>There has been a reconciliation between the Wellingtonians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
and the old Tories, and they are now firmly knit in
opposition to the present Government. Winchilsea, who
was the last Tory who stuck to Lord Grey, renounced him
in a hot speech, which evidently annoyed Lord Grey very
much, for he made a long one in reply to him. Winchilsea
is a silly, blustering, but good-natured and well-meaning
man. Last night &lsquo;Hernani&rsquo; was acted at Bridgewater House
before the Queen and all the Royal Family. Aubin, who had
acted Don Ruy, was sent to Rome, so Francis Leveson took
the part. I was disappointed, though all the company were
or pretended to be in ecstasies. The rhyme does not do,
the room is not good for hearing, and with the exception of
Miss Kemble (who was not so effective as I expected) and
Craven, the actors were execrable.</p>

<p>News came the day before yesterday that Marshal Diebitsch
had died of the cholera. It was suspected that he
had made away with himself, for he has failed so signally
in his campaign against the Poles that his military reputation
is tarnished; and it is known that his recall had
been decreed, and that Count Paskiewitch was to succeed
him. The alarm about the cholera still continues, but the
Government are thrown into great perplexity by the danger
on one hand of the cholera and the loss to trade on the
other. A board of health has been formed, composed of
certain members of the College of Physicians, Sir William
Pym, Sir William Burnet, Sir Byam Martin, Sir James
M&lsquo;Grigor, and Mr. Stewart; and they in their first sitting
advised that all the precautions established by our Orders in
Council against the plague should be adopted against the
cholera. This opinion was given under the authority of
Dr. Warren, who, it appears, exercises the same ascendency
in this Board that he had previously done in the College of
Physicians on the same subject. The fact is that he takes
the safe side. They have nothing to do with trade and
commerce, which must shift for themselves, and probably the
other members will not take upon themselves the responsibility
of opposing measures which, if the disease ever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PREVENTION OF CHOLERA.</span>
appears here, and should they be relaxed, will expose the
physicians to the odium and reproach of having been instrumental
to its introduction. We, however (Auckland,
Poulett Thomson, and I), are resolved to make the Cabinet
take upon themselves the responsibility of framing the permanent
rules which are to guide us during the continuance
of the malady. It is remarkable that there never was more
sickness than there is at present, without its being epidemic,
but thousands of colds, sore throats, fevers, and such like;
and a man at Blackwall has died of the English cholera, and
another is ill of it, but their disorders seem to have nothing
to do with the Indian cholera, though some of the symptoms
are similar. These men cannot have got their cholera from
Russia, but their cases spread alarm.</p>

<h3>June 25th, 1831</h3>

<p>John Russell brought his Bill in last night,
in a good speech as his friends, and a dull one as his enemies,
say. In the Lords Aberdeen attacked Lord Grey&rsquo;s foreign
policy in a poor speech, which just did to show his bitterness
and as a peg for Grey to hang a very good reply upon. The
Duke of Wellington spoke afterwards; not much of a speech,
but gentlemanlike and anti-factious, and <i>approving</i> of all Lord
Grey had done about Belgium. Lord Grey passed a very
fine eulogium upon Lord Ponsonby. However, this was
necessary, for he is going as Minister to Naples, not having
a guinea. The Emperor Don Pedro is coming here, and
Henry Webster is to be his conductor.</p>

<h3>June 30th, 1831</h3>

<p>At Court yesterday to swear in the Duke of
Leinster, Mr. Justice Vaughan, and Sir E. Hyde East. Lord
Ponsonby was there, just returned from Brussels. The first
time of Stanley&rsquo;s and John Russell&rsquo;s being at a Council
since they came into the Cabinet.</p>

<h3>July 3rd, 1831</h3>

<p>Went to Oatlands on Saturday, returned on
Monday; nobody there but Emily Eden. Many revolutions
that place has undergone in my time, from the days of the
Duke of York and its gaieties (well remembered and much
regretted) to its present quiet state. The Belgians have not
yet made up their mind about Leopold, who does not know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
whether he is king or no king. The Reform Bill came on
again last night, but it no longer excites so much interest.
Nobody spoke well but Lord Porchester.</p>

<h3>July 5th, 1831</h3>

<p>The night before last Lord Harewood attacked
Brougham in the House of Lords about the appointment of
a magistrate without consulting him as Lord-Lieutenant.
As usual his own party say he made out a good case, and
the others that he made none. They say (and I believe with
truth) that Brougham does not dislike such scrapes, and is
so confident in his own ingenuity that he never doubts of
getting out of them. Lyndhurst attacked him sharply.
In the House of Commons last night the debate went on
languidly, except a splendid speech from Macaulay and an
answer (not bad, they say) from Murray. Lord Grey sent
for me yesterday morning to talk over the coronation, for in
consequence of what the Duke of Wellington said in the
House the night before he thinks there must be one. The
object is to make it shorter and cheaper than the last,
which occupied the whole day and cost 240,000&#8467;.</p>

<h3>July 8th, 1831</h3>

<p>The second reading of the Reform Bill was
carried at five in the morning by 136 majority, somewhat
greater than the Opposition had reckoned on. Peel made a
powerful speech, but not so good as either of his others on
Reform. Goulburn told me that the speech in answer to
the Lord Advocate on the Irish Bill, when not 100 people
were in the House, was his best. The coronation fixed for
the 23rd. Breakfasted with Rogers; went afterwards to the
Duchess of Bedford&rsquo;s, where I met Lady Lyndhurst. I desired
her to tell Lyndhurst all the Duke had said to me about him,
for in these times it is as well they should draw together. He
will be a match for Brougham in the House of Lords, for he
can be concise, which the other cannot, and the Lords in the
long run will prefer brevity to art, sarcasm, and anything
else.</p>

<p>People are beginning to recover from their terror of the
cholera, seeing that it does not come, and we are now beset
with alarms of a different kind, which are those of the
Scotch merchants for their cargoes. We have a most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONTEST IN POLAND.</span>
disagreeable business on our hands, very troublesome, odious,
and expensive. The public requires that we should take care
of its health, the mercantile world that we should not injure
their trade. All evidence proves that goods are not capable
of bringing in the disorder, but we have appointed a Board
of Health, which is contagionist, and we can&rsquo;t get them to
subscribe to that opinion. We dare not act without its
sanction, and so we are obliged to air goods. This airing
requires more ships and lazarets than we have, and the result
is a perpetual squabbling, disputing, and complaining between
the Privy Council, the Admiralty, the Board of Health, and
the merchants. We have gone on pretty well hitherto, but
more ships arrive every day; the complaints will grow louder,
and the disease rather spreads than diminishes on the
Continent. This cholera has afforded strong proofs of the
partiality of the Prussians in the contest between the
Russians and the Poles. The quarantine restrictions are
always dispensed with for officers passing through the
Prussian territory to join the Russian army. Count Paskiewitch
was allowed to pass without performing any quarantine
at all, and stores and provisions are suffered to be
conveyed to the army, with every facility afforded by the
Prussian authorities and every relaxation of the sanitary
laws. The Duke of Wellington says that the contest will very
soon be over, that the Russian army could not act before
June, and that between February and June the country is
not practicable for military operations. They have now so
many months before them that the weight of their numerical
superiority will crush the Poles. Austria and Prussia, too,
do their utmost by affording every sort of indirect assistance
to the Russians and thwarting the Poles as much as they
can.</p>

<h3>July 10th, 1831</h3>

<p>The last two or three days I have been settling
everything for the
coronation,<a name="FNA_14_07" id="FNA_14_07"></a><a href="#FN_14_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
which is to be confined to the
ceremony in the Abbey and cost as little money and as
little trouble as possible; and yesterday I was the medium
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of great civilities from Lord Grey to the Duke. He desired
me to go to the Duke and show him the course of proceeding
we mean to adopt, and request him to make any
suggestion that occurred to him, and to enquire if he would
have any objection to attend the Council at which it is to be
formally settled on Wednesday, to which Peel and Rosslyn
are likewise invited. I spoke to the Duke and Peel, and
they will both come. All this is mighty polite.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_14_07" id="FN_14_07"></a><a href="#FNA_14_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[The arrangements for coronations are made by a Committee of the
Privy Council, which sits as a Court of Claims.]</p></div>

<p>They have made a fine business of Cobbett&rsquo;s trial; his
insolence and violence were past endurance, but he made an
able speech. The Chief Justice was very timid, and favoured
and complimented him throughout; very unlike what Ellenborough
would have done. The jury were shut up the whole
night, and in the morning the Chief Justice, without consulting
either party, discharged them, which was probably on the
whole the best that could be done. Denman told me that
he expected they would have acquitted him without leaving
the box, and this principally on account of Brougham&rsquo;s
evidence, for Cobbett brought the Chancellor forward and
made him prove that <i>after</i> these very writings, and while
this prosecution was hanging over him, Brougham wrote to
his son &lsquo;Dear Sir,&rsquo; and requesting he would ask his father
for some former publications of his, which he thought would be
of great use on the present occasion in quieting the labourers.
This made a great impression, and the Attorney-General
never knew one word of the letter till he heard it in evidence,
the Chancellor having flourished it off, as is his
custom, and then quite forgotten it. The Attorney told me
that Gurney overheard one juryman say to another, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
you think we had better stop the case? It is useless to go
on.&rsquo; The other, however, declared for hearing it out, so on
the whole it ended as well as it might, just better than an
acquittal, and that is all.</p>

<h3>July 11th, 1831</h3>

<p>Dined with Lord Grey yesterday. In the
middle of dinner Talleyrand got a letter announcing that
Leopold&rsquo;s conditional acceptance of the Belgian throne had
been agreed to by a great majority of the Chamber; and a Mr.
Walker, who brought the news (and left Brussels at five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WELLINGTON AND THE GOVERNMENT.</span>
o&rsquo;clock the day before), came to Lord Grey and told him with
what enthusiasm it had been received there. Lord Grey
wrote to the Chancellor, with whom Leopold was dining, to
tell him of the event.</p>

<p>This morning I got a note from the Duke of Wellington
declining to attend the Council on Wednesday, and desiring
I would impart the same to Lord Grey and the King. He
says that it would give rise to misrepresentations, and so it
would. He is right to decline. It is, however, Peel who
has prevented him, I am certain. When I told Peel on
Saturday, he looked very grave, did not seem to like it, and
said he must confer with the Duke first, as he should be
sorry to do otherwise than he did. Yesterday I know the
Duke dined with Peel, who I have no doubt persuaded him
to send this excuse. The Government are in exceeding
delight at the Duke&rsquo;s conduct ever since he has been in opposition,
which certainly has been very noble, straightforward,
gentlemanlike, and without an atom of faction or mischief
about it. He has done himself great honour; he threw over
Aberdeen completely on that business about foreign policy
which he introduced soon after the meeting of Parliament,
and now he is assisting the Government in their Lieutenancy
Bill, and is in constant communication with Melbourne on
the subject.</p>

<h3>July 13th, 1831</h3>

<p>I took the Duke&rsquo;s note to Lord Grey, who
seemed annoyed, and repeated that he had only intended the
invitation as a mark of attention, and never thought of
shifting any responsibility from his own shoulders; that as
there was a deviation from the old ceremonial, he thought the
Duke&rsquo;s sanction would have satisfied those who might otherwise
have disputed the propriety of such a change. &lsquo;Does he
then,&rsquo; he asked, &lsquo;mean to attend <i>the Committee</i>?&rsquo; I did not
then know; but yesterday in the House of Lords I asked the
Duke, and he said &lsquo;No, for the same reasons,&rsquo; that upon consideration
he was sure he had better not go, that by so doing
he might give umbrage to his own party, and he could only
do good by exercising a powerful influence over them and restraining
them, and that his means of doing good would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
impaired by any appearance of approximating himself to
Government, that when the general plan of the arrangements
was settled, he should have no objection to lend a
helping hand, if wanted, to the details with which he was very
conversant. I wrote on a slip of paper that he would <i>not</i>
come, and gave it to Lord Grey, who said nothing. Peel
did not write to me, but he and Rosslyn do the same as
the Duke.</p>

<p>The Belgian deputation came yesterday, and Lebeau and
his colleagues were in the House of Lords. We had been
promised a good day there between Londonderry and
Brougham and Plunket, but the former made a tiresome,
long speech; the latter spoke civilly and dully; and
Brougham not at all, so it ended in smoke. In the other
House on Monday the Ministers got a good majority (102) on
the wine duties, to their great delight, but the Opposition were
not only mortified at the defeat, but disgusted and enraged at
the conduct of Peel (their leader, as they considered him),
who came into the House, got up in the middle of Herries&rsquo;
speech, walked out and was heard of no more that night;
never voted, nor gave any notice of his intention not to vote.
The moral effect of this upon his party is immense, and has
served to destroy the very little confidence they had in him
before. It is impossible to conceive by what motives he is
actuated, because if they were purely selfish it would seem
that he defeats his own object; for what can he gain by disgusting
and alienating his party, when although they cannot
do without him, it is equally true that he cannot do without
them? I walked home with William Banks, who went
largely into the whole question of Peel&rsquo;s extraordinary disposition
and conduct, and said how disheartening it was, and
what a blow to those who looked to him as a leader in these
troublous times. Henry Currey (no important person, but
whose opinion is that of fifty other like him) told me that his
conduct had been <i>atrocious</i>, and that he had himself voted in
the minority against his opinion because he thought it right
to sacrifice that opinion to the interests of his party. The
fact is, if Peel had imparted his sentiments to his party he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RESERVE OF MR. PEEL.</span>
might have prevented their dividing on this question with
the greatest ease. There is nothing they are not ready to do
at his bidding, but his coldness and reserve are so impenetrable
that nobody can ascertain his sentiments or divine his
intentions, and thus he leaves his party in the lurch without
vouchsafing to give them any reason or explanation of his
conduct. In the meantime the other party (as if each was
destined to suffer more from the folly of its friends than the
hostility of its foes) has been thrown into great confusion by
Lord Milton&rsquo;s notice to propose an alteration in the franchise,
and a meeting was called of all the friends of Government
at Althorp, when Milton made a speech just such as any
opponent of the Bill might make in the House of Commons,
going over the old ground of Fox, Pitt, Burke, and others
having sat for rotten boroughs. They were annoyed to the
last degree, and the more provoked when reflecting that it was
for him Althorp had been led to spend an immense sum of
money, and compromise his character besides in the Northamptonshire
election. His obstinacy and impracticability
are so extreme that nobody can move him, and Sefton told
me that nothing could be more unsatisfactory than the termination
of the meeting. I guess, however, that they will
find some means or other of quieting him.</p>

<p>The Opposition divided last night 187 against 284 on the
question of hearing counsel for the condemned boroughs&mdash;not
so good a division for the minority as they expected, and
after a very powerful speech of Attwood&rsquo;s, to which nobody
listened.</p>

<p>There is a fresh access of alarm on account of the cholera,
which has broken out at St. Petersburg, and will probably
spread over Germany. The cordon of troops which kept it
off last year from St. Petersburg appears to have been withdrawn,
which is no doubt the cause of its appearance there.
We have constant reports of supposed cases of disease and
death, but up to this period it does not appear to have shown
itself here, though a case was transmitted to us from
Glasgow exceedingly like it. The sick man had not come from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
any infected place. The Board of Health are, however, in
great alarm, and the authorities generally think we shall
have it. From all I can observe from the facts of the case
I am convinced that the liability to contagion is greatly
diminished by the influence of sea air, for which reason I
doubt that it will be brought here across the water. If it
does come it will pass through France first. The King of
Prussia has at last insisted upon a rigid execution of the
quarantine laws in his dominions. Marshal Paskiewitch was
detained on his road to take the command of the army, and
sent a courier to the King to request he might be released
forthwith, urging the importance of the Emperor to have his
report of the state of the army; but the King refused, and
sent word that the Emperor himself had submitted to quarantine,
and so his aide-de-camp might do the same.</p>

<h3>July 14th, 1831</h3>

<p>The effects of Peel&rsquo;s leaving the party to shift
for itself were exhibited the night before last. He went away
(there was no reason why he should not, except that he
should have stayed to <i>manage</i> the debate and keep his people
in order), and the consequence was that they went on in a
vexatious squabble of repeated adjournments till eight o&rsquo;clock
in the morning, when Government at last beat them. The
Opposition gradually dwindled down to twenty-five people,
headed by Stormont, Tullamore, and Brudenell, while the
Government kept 180 together to the last; between parties
so animated and so led there can be no doubt on which
side will be the success. The Government were in high
spirits at the result, and thought the fatigue well repaid
by the display of devotion on the part of their friends and
of factious obstinacy on that of their enemies. After these
two nights it is impossible not to consider the Tory party as
having ceased to exist for all the practical and legitimate
ends of political association&mdash;that is, as far as the House of
Commons is concerned, where after all the battle must be
fought. There is still a rabble of Opposition, tossed about by
every wind of folly and passion, and left to the vagaries and
eccentricities of Wetherell, or Attwood, or Sadler, or the intemperate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PREPARATIONS FOR THE CORONATION.</span>
zeal of such weak fanatics as the three Lords above
mentioned; but for a grave, deliberative, efficient Opposition
there seem to be no longer the elements, or they are so scattered
and disunited that they never can come together, and
the only man who might have collected, and formed, and
directed them begs leave to be excused. It is a wretched
state of things and can portend no good. If there had not
been prognostications of ruin and destruction to the State in
all times, proceeding from all parties, which the event has
universally falsified, I should believe that the consummation
of evil was really at hand; as it is I cannot feel that certainty
of destruction that many do, though I think we are
more seriously menaced than ever we were before, because
the danger is of a very different description. But there is
an elasticity in the institutions of this country, which may
rise up for the purpose of checking these proceedings, and in
the very uncertainty of what may be produced and engendered
by such measures there is hope of salvation.</p>

<p>Yesterday a Council was held at St. James&rsquo;s for the coronation;
the Princes, Ministers, Archbishop of Canterbury, and
Bishop of London were present. The King read an address
to the Lords desiring that his coronation might be short, and
that all the ceremonies might be dispensed with except those
in the church. Lord Grey had composed a paper in which he
had made the King say that these ceremonies were at variance
with the genius of the age we live in, and suited to another
period of society; but the Archbishop objected to these
expressions, and thought it better to give the injunction without
the comments; so Lord Grey wrote another and shorter
paper, but he showed the first to Lord Lansdowne and me,
and we both told him that we thought the Archbishop was
right and that the second paper was the best. The Duke of
Gloucester was very indignant at not having been summoned
in a more respectful way than by a common circular, and complained
to the Lord
President.<a name="FNA_14_08" id="FNA_14_08"></a><a href="#FN_14_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
I told him to throw it all on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
me. He had been grumbling to the Duke of Sussex before,
who did not care. Leopold was too much of a king to
attend, so he came to the levee (but <i>en prince</i> only) and not
to the Council. Lieven told me it was true that the Grand
Duke Constantine was dead, and that it was a very good
thing.</p>

<h3>July 15th, 1831</h3>

<p>A Committee of Council sat yesterday at the
Office about the coronation; present, the Cabinet, Dukes of
Gloucester and Sussex, Archbishop and Bishop of London;
much discussion and nothing done. Brougham raised every
sort of objection about the services and the dispensing with
them, and would have it the King <i>could</i> not dispense with
them; finally, the Attorney-General and Solicitor-General
were sent for to the House of Lords and desired to reconsider
the Proclamation.</p>

<h3>July 20th, 1831</h3>

<p>I have been laid up with the gout these last
few days, unable to move, but without violent pain. The
Committee of Council met again on Friday last, when the
Proclamation was settled. A Court of Claims is to sit, but to
be prohibited from receiving any claims except those relating
to the ceremonies in the Abbey. The Lords went to St.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
James&rsquo;s and held the Council, at which the King made a
little speech, to the effect that he would be crowned to satisfy
the tender consciences of those who thought it necessary,
but that he thought that it was his duty (as this country,
in common with every other, was labouring under distress)
to make it as economical as possible. A difficulty arose
about the publication of the Proclamation, usually done by
heralds with certain ceremonies. The first proclamation is
not the one to be acted on; the second does not announce
the coronation, but refers to the first. I asked Brougham
what was to be done. He said both must be read. Lord
Grey suggested neither, which was done.</p>

<p>The other day Long Wellesley carried off his daughter,
a ward in Chancery, from her guardians, and secreted her.
The matter was brought before the Chancellor, who sent for
Wellesley. He came, and refused to give her up; so Brougham
committed him to the Fleet Prison. The matter was
brought the next day before the House of Commons, and referred
to their Committee of Privileges; and in the meantime
Brougham has been making a great splutter about his
authority and his Court both on the judicial bench and
from the Woolsack. The lawyers in the House of Commons
were divided as to Wellesley&rsquo;s right of privilege in such a
case.<a name="FNA_15_01" id="FNA_15_01"></a><a href="#FN_15_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_15_01" id="FN_15_01"></a><a href="#FNA_15_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[Both the Chancellor and Mr. Wellesley wrote to the Speaker, and
their letters were read to the House before the Committee of Privileges was
appointed. Meanwhile Mr. Wellesley remained at his house in Dover
Street in charge of two officers of the Court of Chancery. There is, I
believe, no doubt that the committal was good, and that Mr. Wellesley&rsquo;s
privilege as a member of Parliament did not protect him, a contempt of the
Court having been committed. A similar point has recently been raised in
the Court of Queen&rsquo;s Bench upon the committal of Mr. Whalley.]</p></div>

<p>There has been exhibited in the course of the last few
days one of the most disgraceful scenes (produced by the
Reform Bill) ever witnessed. On the question of the disfranchisement
of Appleby a certain Alderman Thompson,
member for the City, who stood deeply pledged to Reform,
voted for hearing counsel in defence of the borough, on which
there was a meeting of his ward, or of certain of his constituents,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ALDERMAN THOMPSON AND HIS CONSTITUENTS.</span>
to consider his conduct. He was obliged to appear
before them, and, after receiving a severe lecture, to confess
that he had been guilty of inadvertence, to make many submissive
apologies, and promise to vote no more but in obedience
to the Minister. It is always an agreeable pastime to
indulge one&rsquo;s virtuous indignation, and wish to have been in
the place of such an one for the sake of doing what he ought to
have done but did not do, by which, without any of the risk
of a very difficult and unpleasant situation, one has all the
imaginary triumph of eloquence, independence, and all kinds
of virtue; and so in this instance I feel that I should have
liked to pour upon these wretches the phials of my wrath
and contempt. If the alderman had had one spark of spirit
he would have spurned the terrors of this plebeian inquisition,
and told them that they had elected him, and that it was
his intention, as long as he continued their representative,
to vote as he thought proper, always redeeming the pledges
he had given at his election; that he would not submit to
be questioned for this or any other vote, and if they were
not satisfied with his conduct when the Parliament should
be over they might choose whom they would in his place.
What makes the case the more absurd is, that this question
of Appleby is monstrous, and it never ought (by their own
principle) to have been put in Schedule A at all. There was
a debate and a division on it last night, and a majority for
the Ministers of seventy-five in a very full House; the worst
division they have yet had. Every small victory in the
House of Commons is probably equivalent to a great defeat
in the House of Lords, unless they do what is now talked of&mdash;make
as many Peers as may be necessary to carry the Bill,
which I doubt their daring to do or the King consenting to
do. The lapse of time and such difficulties and absurdities
will probably obstruct the Bill, so as to prevent its passing.
God knows what we shall have instead.</p>

<p>Prince Leopold started on Saturday, having put his pension
into trustees&rsquo; hands (by the advice of Lambton), to keep
up Claremont and pay his debts and pensions, and then hand
over the residue to the Exchequer, the odds being that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
none of it ever gets there, and that he is back here before
the debts are paid. It seems that, desirous as he had been
to go, when the time drew near he got alarmed, and wanted
to back out, but they brought him (though with difficulty) to
the point. He has proposed to the Princess Louise, King
Louis Philippe&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>Halford has been with me this morning gossiping (which
he likes); he gave me an account of his discovery of the head
of Charles I. in St. George&rsquo;s Chapel, Windsor, to which he
was directed by Wood&rsquo;s account in the &lsquo;Athenæ Oxonienses.&rsquo;
He says that they also found the coffin of Henry VIII., but
that the air had penetrated and the body had been reduced
to a skeleton. By his side was Jane Seymour&rsquo;s coffin
untouched, and he has no doubt her body is perfect. The
late King intended to have it opened, and he says he will
propose it to this King. By degrees we may visit the
remains of the whole line of Tudor and Plantagenet too,
and see if those famous old creatures were like their effigies.
He says Charles&rsquo;s head was exactly as Vandyke had painted
him.</p>

<h3>July 26th, 1831</h3>

<p>At Oatlands on Saturday, and came back on
Sunday night. Nobody there but my father, mother, Walpole,
Sneyd, and Alava; very different from what I once
remember it. There has been a great deal of talk about the
Duke of Wellington giving Lord Munster the Lieutenancy
of the Tower, the truth of which is as follows:&mdash;It is in the
King&rsquo;s gift, and he sent to the Duke and desired him to name
somebody. The Duke would have liked to name one of three&mdash;Fitzroy
Somerset, Colin Campbell, or Hardinge. The latter
would not have been agreeable to Government, and therefore
it would have occasioned the King an embarrassment;
the second was provided for, and Lord Hill advised the first
to remain as he is (though I don&rsquo;t see why he could not have
had both); so the Duke thought it would gratify the King if
he was to name Munster. Munster wrote a very civil letter
to the Duke, full of thanks and saying that he begged he would
not think of him if he had anybody else to give it to, and
that he would take upon himself to explain to the King his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CHOLERA.</span>
not accepting it. The Duke persisted, and so he had it. I
must say he might have found some one out of the number
of his old officers to give it to rather than Munster.</p>

<p>The King of France&rsquo;s Speech arrived yesterday, but
nothing was said in the House of Lords, because Lord Grey
was at Windsor. It will make a stir&mdash;the general tone of it,
and the demolition of the fortresses which cost us seven
millions. Not one of the papers made a remark upon it;
nothing will do for them but Reform.</p>

<p>Fresh claims have been raised about cholera morbus.
A man at Port Glasgow insists upon it, without much apparent
reason, that it prevails there; so we have sent a medical
man down, in order to quiet people&rsquo;s minds and to set the
question at rest. Lord Grey, who is credulous, believes the
Glasgow man&rsquo;s story, and spread the news in his own family,
who immediately dispersed it over the rest of the town, and
yesterday nobody could talk of anything else; not believing
it very much, and not understanding it at all, for if they did
they would not be so flippant. Lady Holland wrote to Lord
Lansdowne to desire he would recommend her the best
<i>cholera</i> doctor that he had heard of. I have just received a
letter from Moore, saying he has ordered his publisher to
send me a copy of &lsquo;Lord Edward Fitzgerald,&rsquo; and that he
only sends copies to the Duke of Leinster and me, but begs I
will send him no opinion, for &lsquo;opinions fidget him&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;genus
irritabile vatum.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>July 27th, 1831</h3>

<p>Yesterday Aberdeen asked Lord Grey some
questions in a very few words, accompanied as usual with
a sneer, which is very unbecoming, and of course gave
Lord Grey the advantage of repelling it with scorn. The
Duke spoke, and pretty well, but laid some stress more on
Portugal than upon Belgium, which is what I cannot understand,
but Alava told me that when he came to town yesterday
he had said to him that, as an Englishman, he had never
felt so deeply affected for the honour of his country as in
this transaction. I met him after the debate, and he said
he thought he had done some good by what he said. The
question of the Belgian fortresses is not without great difficulty,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
and the strong part of it for Government is that their
demolition was agreed to by all the Powers interested (except
Holland), and without the presence of the French Plenipotentiary
at the meeting when it was decided. I am inclined
to think that the manner in which it was blurted out in the
King of France&rsquo;s Speech, as a clap-trap for him, will have
made the principal difficulty, though the policy may be very
questionable.</p>

<h3>July 28th, 1831</h3>

<p>On Tuesday night they got through Schedule
A, but in a very bungling manner, and the events of the
night, its enemies say, damaged the Bill, not, however,
that anything can hurt it in the House of Commons, though
such things may tell in the House of Lords; but on the
question of Saltash, which the Opposition did not consider
as a very strong case, so little that they had not intended to
divide on it, John Russell and the rest suddenly gave way,
and without informing their friends moved that it ought to
be in Schedule B. On a division all the Ministers voted with,
the Opposition, so the borough was transferred to B. Their
friends were furious, and not without reason, that they had
not determined where it ought to be placed, and have transferred
it themselves instead of leaving them in the dilemma
they were in when the division arrived. A court and levee
yesterday.</p>

<h3>Oatlands, July 31st, 1831</h3>

<p>The Arbuthnots and Mr. Loch here.
I rode down after the Opera last night; walked for an hour
and a half with Arbuthnot under the shade of one of the great
trees, talking of various old matters and some new, principally
about Canning and his disputes and differences with
the Duke of Wellington. He says that the Duke&rsquo;s principal
objection to Canning was the knowledge of his having
negotiated with the Whigs previously to Lord Liverpool&rsquo;s
illness, which was communicated to the Duke; he would not
say by whom. The person who went between them was Sir
Robert Wilson, deputed by Brougham, and those who afterwards
joined Canning. Sir Robert spoke to Huskisson, and
he to Canning. What they said was this: that finding his
view so liberal, they were ready to support and join him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CANNING&rsquo;S NEGOTIATION WITH THE WHIGS.</span>
in the event of his becoming Minister (on Lord Liverpool&rsquo;s
death or resignation) that they would serve under him. Arbuthnot
does not know what answer Canning sent to this, nor
whether he <i>did</i> anything on it, but when on Lord Liverpool&rsquo;s
illness Canning went to the King at Windsor, he told him that
if the Tories would not consent to his being named Minister
&lsquo;he was sure of the Whigs,&rsquo; but this he entreated the King
not to mention. Immediately after Canning the Duke went
to the King, and to him the King directly repeated what
Canning had said. The Duke told the King that he was
already aware of Canning&rsquo;s intercourse with the Whigs, and
with that knowledge that he could not consent to his being
Prime Minister, as he could have no confidence in him.
Shortly after this, and before the resignation of the Ministers,
but after the difficulties had begun, Knighton came to
Arbuthnot, and said he was afraid his Royal Master had done
a great deal of mischief by repeating to the Duke what
Canning had said, that he was very anxious to bring the
Duke and Canning together again, and asked him (Arbuthnot)
to go with him to Canning and see what could be done.
Arbuthnot declined, but said if Canning <i>wished</i> to see him he
would go. Canning sent for him, and they had a long conversation,
in which he expressed his desire to go on with the
Duke, and it was agreed the Duke should call on him and
have a conversation and see what could be arranged. The
Duke called on him, and they talked of a variety of matters,
but not a word passed about the formation of a new Ministry.
Arbuthnot went to the House, and told Canning how
much he was surprised and disappointed that nothing had
come of this conversation, to which he made no reply, but
Arbuthnot found afterwards that between his leaving Canning
and the Duke&rsquo;s going to him Peel had been to him
and proposed that the Duke should be Prime Minister. This
so offended Canning, believing that it was a measure of the
party and done with the Duke&rsquo;s consent, that he resolved
not to utter a word to the Duke on the subject, and so ended
the hopes of their agreement.</p>

<p>It does not appear, however, as if anything could have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
been done, for Canning was bent upon being Prime Minister;
and I asked Arbuthnot to what the Duke would have
consented, and he said, &lsquo;Not to that,&rsquo; that after the transaction
with the Whigs he could not have felt sufficient confidence
in Canning to agree to his being Prime Minister.
(If he distrusted Canning he ought to have refused to act
with him at all, not merely objected to his being Prime
Minister, but the ground of his objection was shifted.)
Originally the King could not bear Canning, and he was
only persuaded by the Duke to take him into the Cabinet.
Afterwards he was so offended at the influence he
acquired there, and particularly with that which he had got
over the mind of Lord Liverpool, that he one day sent for
Arbuthnot and desired him to tell Lord Liverpool that he
could not endure to see Canning make a puppet of him, and
he would rather he was Prime Minister at once than have
all the power without the name by governing him (Lord
Liverpool) as he pleased, and that unless he could shake off
this influence he was determined not to let him continue at
the head of the Government, and, moreover, he must find
some means of getting rid of Canning altogether. This
Arbuthnot wrote to Lord Liverpool, who wrote an answer
couched in terms of indignation, saying he by no means
coveted his situation, that he was sure his colleagues would
resent any indignity offered to him, and that the King had
better take care what he was about, and not, by producing
disunion in the Government, incur the risk of making the
end of his reign as disastrous as the beginning of it had been
prosperous.</p>

<p>Not very long after Canning got into favour, and in
this way:&mdash;Harriet Wilson at the time of her connexion
with Lord Ponsonby got hold of some of Lady Conyingham&rsquo;s
letters to him, and she wrote to Ponsonby, threatening,
unless he gave her a large sum, to come to England
and publish everything she could. This produced dismay
among all the parties, and they wanted to get Ponsonby
away and to silence the woman. In this dilemma Knighton
advised the King to have recourse to Canning, who saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CANNING AND THE LIVERPOOL ADMINISTRATION.</span>
the opening to favour, jumped at it, and instantly offered
to provide for Ponsonby and do anything which could
relieve the King from trouble. Ponsonby was sent to Buenos
Ayres forthwith, and the letters were bought up. From
this time Canning grew in favour, which he took every
means to improve, and shortly gained complete ascendancy
over the King.</p>

<p>Arbuthnot said that Canning and Castlereagh had always
gone on well together after their reconciliation, but that
Lord Liverpool&rsquo;s subjection to him arose more from fear than
affection. Liverpool told Arbuthnot that he earnestly desired
to resign his office, that his health was broken, and he
was only retained by the consideration that his retirement
might be the means of breaking up a Government which he
had (through the kindness of his colleagues to him) been
enabled to hold together; that Canning worked with a
twenty-horse power; that his sensitiveness was such that he
[Canning] felt every paragraph in a newspaper that reflected
on him, and that the most trifling causes produced an irritation
on his mind, which was always vented upon him (Lord
Liverpool), and that every time the door was opened he
dreaded the arrival of a packet from Canning. Arbuthnot
had been in great favour with the King, who talked to him
and consulted him, but he nearly cut him after the disunion
consequent on Canning&rsquo;s appointment. Knighton came to
Arbuthnot and desired him to try and prevail on the Duke to
consent to Canning&rsquo;s being Prime Minister, which he told
him was useless, and from that time the King was just civil
to the Duke and that was all. The Duke had always suspected
that Canning wanted all along to be Prime Minister,
and that when he sent him to Russia to congratulate Nicholas
it was to get him out of the way, and he was the more
convinced because Canning proposed to him to go on to
Moscow for the coronation, which he positively refused,
having promised his friends to be back in April, which he accordingly
was. Canning never had a great opinion of Huskisson,
nor really liked him, though he thought him very useful
from being conversant with the subjects on which he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
himself most ignorant&mdash;trade and finance; but he did not
contemplate his being in the Cabinet, and had no confidence
in his judgment or his discretion; and this tallies with what
Lady Canning told me, though certainly he did not do Huskisson
justice in any way, which Arbuthnot admitted. Knighton
behaved exceedingly well during the King&rsquo;s illness, and by
the vigilant watch he kept over the property of various kinds
prevented the pillage which Lady Conyngham would otherwise
have made. She knew everything, but did not much
trouble herself about affairs, being chiefly intent upon amassing
money and collecting jewels.</p>

<p>He talked a great deal of Peel, of the difficulty of going on
with him, of his coldness, incommunicativeness; that at the
time of the opening the Liverpool Railroad he had invited the
Duke, Aberdeen, and some more to meet at Drayton to consider
of strengthening themselves; that they had left the place just
as they had gone to it, nothing settled and nothing elicited
from Peel; that on the late occasion of the wine duties they
had gone to Peel and asked him whether they should fight
out and divide on it; that he had referred them to Goulburn,
who had decided in the affirmative, on which he had
agreed to their friends being mustered, but that he took
offence at something that was said in debate, and marched
off <i>sans mot dire</i>; that somebody was sent after him to represent
the bad effect of his departure, and entreat him to
return, but he was gone to bed. This is by no means the
first time Arbuthnot has spoken to me about Peel in this
strain and with such feelings. How are the Duke and he
to make a Government again, especially after what Lyndhurst
said of the Duke? Necessity may bring them together,
but though common interest and common danger may unite
them, there the seeds of disunion always must be. I have
scribbled down all I can recollect of a very loose conversation,
and perhaps something else may occur to me by-and-by.</p>

<p>In the meantime to return to the events of the present
day. Althorp raised a terrible storm on Friday by proposing
that the House should sit on Saturday. They spent six
hours debating the question, which might have been occupied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LONG WELLESLEY AND BROUGHAM.</span>
in the business; so that, though they did not sit yesterday,
they gained nothing and made bad blood. Yesterday
morning Murray made a conciliatory speech, which Burdett
complimented, and all went on harmoniously. John Russell
is ill, nearly done up with fatigue and exertion and the bad
atmosphere he breathes for several hours every night.</p>

<p>Long Wellesley has given up his daughter and has been
discharged from arrest. I met the Solicitor-General yesterday,
who told me this, and said that Brougham had been in the
midst of his blustering terribly nervous about it. This was
clear, for both he and Wellesley were waiting for the report
of the Committee of the House of Commons, though Brougham
affected to hold it cheap, and talked very big of what he
should do and should have done had it been unfavourable
to his authority. The fact is that Long Wellesley was
contumacious, but after a short confinement he knocked under
and yielded to the Chancellor on all points, and was released
from durance.</p>

<p>We had a meeting on the Coronation business yesterday
morning, and took into consideration the estimates. That
from the Chamberlain&rsquo;s Office was 70,000&#8467;. and upwards,
which was referred to a sub-committee to dissect and report
upon.</p>

<h3>August 5th, 1831</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning arrived the news of
Casimir Périer&rsquo;s resignation in consequence of the division
in the Chamber of Deputies on the election of President.
He had very unnecessarily committed himself by declaring he
would resign if Lafitte was elected, and though the other
candidate (M. Girod de l&rsquo;Ain) was chosen, as it was, only by
a majority of five, he considered this tantamount to a defeat,
and accordingly went out of
office.<a name="FNA_15_02" id="FNA_15_02"></a><a href="#FN_15_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
It was supposed, but not
quite certain, that Molé would be First Minister, but without
much chance of being able to keep that post.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_15_02" id="FN_15_02"></a><a href="#FNA_15_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[M. Casimir Périer did not retire from office on this occasion, though
he had momentarily resigned it. He remained in power till his death
which took place from cholera in the following year.]</p></div>

<p>At the same time comes intelligence that the King of
Holland has marched into Belgium at three points with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
three corps under the Prince of Orange, Prince Frederick,
and the Prince of Nassau. This, however, was premature,
for it turns out that the Prince of Orange in a proclamation
to his army declares that the armistice was to end last night
at half-past nine, and that he marches &lsquo;to secure equitable
terms of separation,&rsquo; not therefore for the purpose of reconquest.
I saw Lord Grey in the morning in a state of great
consternation, the more particularly as he told me a Dutch
Plenipotentiary had arrived the day before with full powers
to treat, and that he had not in his intercourse with him
and with Palmerston uttered one word of the King of Holland&rsquo;s
intentions. In the evening I had a long conversation
with Matuscewitz. He says that it is impossible to
foresee the end of all this, but that the most probable event
is a general war. Coming at the moment of a change in the
French Ministry, nobody can guess what the French may do,
and the Conferences are useless, because any resolution they
may make may probably be totally inapplicable to the state
of things produced by events hastening on elsewhere. The
King of Holland has all along very justly complained of the
proceedings of the Allies towards him, which they justify by
necessity (&lsquo;the tyrant&rsquo;s plea&rsquo;) and to which he has been
obliged sulkily to submit, though always protesting and
never acquiescing, except in an armistice to which he agreed.
Meantime the Allies went on negotiating, but without
making much progress, and the Dutchman borrowed money
and put his army on a respectable footing. It is remarkable
that as long as he held out that he sought the reunion he
could get no money at all, but no sooner did he renounce the
idea of reunion, and propose to make war for objects more
immediately national to the Dutch, than he got a loan filled
(in two days) to the amount of about a million sterling.
When the proposition was made to Leopold, though no
arrangement was actually agreed upon, there was a general
understanding that the King of Holland would consent to the
separation of the two States, and that the Belgians should
resign their claims to Limbourg and Luxembourg, and after
Lord Ponsonby&rsquo;s letter which made so much noise, Falck&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">HOLLAND AND BELGIUM.</span>
protestation, and Ponsonby&rsquo;s recall this seemed to be clearly
established. When Leopold received the offer of the Crown,
he only consented to take it upon an understanding that the
Belgians would agree to the terms prescribed by the Allies;
but before the whole thing was settled he took fright and
began to repent, and it was with some difficulty he was at last
persuaded to go by the Belgian deputies with assurances that
these terms would be complied with. Go, however, he did,
and that unaccompanied by any person of weight or consequence
from this country. Matuscewitz told me that he
went on his knees to Palmerston to send somebody with
him who would prevent his getting into scrapes, and that
Talleyrand and Falck, by far the best heads among them,
had both predicted that Leopold would speedily commit
some folly the consequences of which might be
irreparable.<a name="FNA_15_03" id="FNA_15_03"></a><a href="#FN_15_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Our Government, however, paid no attention to these remonstrances,
and he was suffered to go alone. Accordingly
he had no sooner arrived than, intoxicated with the applause
he received, he forgot all that had occurred here and all
the resolutions of the Allies, and flourished off speeches in
direct contradiction to them, and announced his determination
to comprehend the disputed provinces in his new
kingdom. It is no wonder that this excited the indignation
of the King of Holland, but it is unfortunate that he could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
not be patient a little longer. Notwithstanding his march,
however, his Plenipotentiary here has full power to treat of
all the disputed points, and is authorised to put a stop to
hostilities at any moment when he can see the prospect of
satisfaction; it is, however, believed here (though at present
not on any sufficient grounds) that Prussia secretly supports
the King of Holland. The danger is that France may
without any further communication with her Allies consider
the aggression of the Dutch as a justification of a corresponding
movement on her part, and should this happen the
Prussians would no longer deem themselves bound by the
common obligations which united all the conferring and
mediating Powers, and a general war would infallibly ensue.
Nor is it unlikely that the French Ministry, beset as they are
with difficulties, and holding their offices <i>de die in diem</i>, may
think a war the best expedient for occupying the nation and
bringing all the restless spirits and unquiet humours into one
focus. I have long been of opinion that such mighty armaments
and such a nervous state of things cannot end without
a good deal of blood-letting. [The Prussians did not support
the Dutch, the French did march, and war did not ensue.&mdash;<i>August 28th</i>.]</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_15_03" id="FN_15_03"></a><a href="#FNA_15_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[This account of Leopold&rsquo;s arrival in Belgium is hardly fair, and forms
an amusing contrast to Baron Stockmar&rsquo;s narrative of the same occurrence in
his &lsquo;Memoirs,&rsquo; p. 180. Unquestionably Leopold showed far more foresight,
judgment, and resolution than Mr. Greville gave him credit for. He was
not accompanied by &lsquo;any person of weight or consequence&rsquo; from this
country, because that would have given him the air of a puppet and a
British nominee. But Stockmar was with him. The King entered
Brussels on the 21st of July, and was well received. On the 4th of August
the Dutch broke the truce and invaded Belgium. It was impossible to
provide against so sudden a movement, and the Army of the Scheldt was
beaten at Louvain on the 12th of August. The King then claimed the
intervention of France and England in defence of the neutrality and independence
of Belgium, which had been guaranteed to him by the treaty of
the eighteen articles under which he had accepted the Crown. But the
passage in the text is curious, because it shows how little confidence was
felt at that time in a prince who turned out to be one of the ablest rulers
and politicians of his time.]</p></div>

<p><i>At night</i>.&mdash;Lord Grey was attacked by Aberdeen to-night
on his foreign policy, and particularly about Portugal, and
he is said to have made a splendid speech. Sir Henry
Seton arrived from Liverpool to announce what is going on,
and he is bent on fighting at present. Abercromby, who is
come likewise, reports that he has 50,000 or 60,000 men.</p>

<h3>August 9th, 1831</h3>

<p>On Saturday morning we were saluted
with intelligence that on the French King&rsquo;s hearing of the
Dutch invasion he ordered Marshal Gérard, with 50,000
men, to march into Belgium; and great was the alarm
here: the funds fell and everybody was prepared for immediate
war. In the afternoon I called upon Lord Grey
at East Sheen (in my way to Monk&rsquo;s Grove, where I was
going) to say something to him about the coronation, and
found him with a more cheerful countenance than I expected.
He did not appear alarmed at what the French had done,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE QUEEN&rsquo;S CROWN.</span>
and very well satisfied with the manner of their doing it,
marching only in virtue of their guarantee and proclaiming
their own neutrality and the Belgian independence, and the
King had previously received the Belgian Minister. I told
him I thought Leopold&rsquo;s folly had been the cause of it, and
that his speeches about Luxembourg had given the Dutch
King a pretext. He said, not at all, and that the King of
Holland would have done this under any circumstances,
which I took leave to doubt, though I did not think it
necessary to say
so.<a name="FNA_15_04" id="FNA_15_04"></a><a href="#FN_15_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_15_04" id="FN_15_04"></a><a href="#FNA_15_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[Lord Grey&rsquo;s composure was mainly due to the entire confidence he
felt in the honour of the Duc de Broglie, then French Minister of Foreign
Affairs, who had given positive assurances to the British Cabinet that the
intervention of France would be confined to the immediate object in view.
This confidence was equally honourable to both statesmen, and these assurances
were faithfully fulfilled.]</p></div>

<p>On Sunday, overtaken by the most dreadful storm I ever
saw&mdash;flashes of lightning, crashes of thunder, and the rain
descending like a waterspout&mdash;I rode to Windsor, to settle
with the Queen what sort of crown she would have to be
crowned in. I was ushered into the King&rsquo;s presence, who
was sitting at a red table in the sitting-room of George IV.,
looking over the flower garden. A picture of Adolphus Fitzclarence
was behind him (a full-length), and one of the
parson, Rev. Augustus Fitzclarence, in a Greek dress,
opposite. He sent for the Queen, who came with the
Landgravine and one of the King&rsquo;s daughters, Lady Augusta
Erskine, the widow of Lord Cassilis&rsquo;s son. She looked at
the drawings, meant apparently to be civil to me in her ungracious
way, and said she would have none of our crowns,
that she did not like to wear a hired crown, and asked me if
I thought it was right that she should. I said, &lsquo;Madam,
I can only say that the late King wore one at his coronation.&rsquo;
However she said, &lsquo;I do not like it, and I have
got jewels enough, so I will have them made up myself.&rsquo; The
King said to me, &lsquo;Very well; then <i>you</i> will have to pay for
the setting.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;I shall pay for it all
myself.&rsquo; The King looked well, but seemed infirm. I talked
to Taylor afterwards, who said he had very little doubt this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
storm in Belgium would blow over, and agreed that Leopold&rsquo;s
folly had been in great measure the cause of it. There have
been discussions in both Houses, which have in some measure
quieted people&rsquo;s apprehensions. To-day that ass Lord
Londonderry (who has never yet had his windows mended
from the time they were broken by the mob at the Reform
illumination) brings on a motion about Belgium.</p>

<h3>August 11th, 1831</h3>

<p>Nothing new these last two days. Londonderry&rsquo;s
motion produced an angry debate, but no division.
Brougham is said to have been very good. The Government
wanted to divide, but the Opposition know that it is not
their interest to provoke a trial of strength. The Ministers,
if beaten, would not go out, and they are anxious to see what
their opponents&rsquo; strength is. At Court yesterday, when
Van de Weyer, the new Belgian Minister, made his appearance.
I said to Esterhazy, &lsquo;You will blow this business over,
sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; He said, &lsquo;Yes, I think we shall <i>this time</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Nothing remarkable in the House of Commons but Lord
John Russell&rsquo;s declaration that &lsquo;this Bill would not be final
if it was not found to work as well as the people desired,&rsquo;
which is sufficiently impudent considering that hitherto they
have always pretended that it was to be final, and that it
was made so comprehensive only that it might be so; this
has been one of their grand arguments, and now we are
never to sit down and rest, but go on changing till we get a
good fit, and that for a country which will have been made
so fidgety that it won&rsquo;t stand still to be measured. Hardinge,
whom I found at dinner at the Athenæum yesterday,
told me he was convinced that a revolution in this country
was inevitable; and such is the opinion of others who
support this Bill, not because they think concession will
avert it, but will let it come more gradually and with less
violence. I have always been convinced that the country
was in no danger of revolutiorobberies n, and still believe that if one
does come it will be from the passing of this Bill, which will
introduce the principle of change and whet the appetites of
those who never will be satisfied with any existing order of
things; or if it follows on the rejection of this Bill, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ELLEN TREE.</span>
I doubt, it will be owing to the concentration of all the
forces that are opposed to our present institutions, and the
divisions, jealousies, rivalships, and consequent weakness of
all those who ought to defend them. God only knows how
it will all end. There has been but one man for many years
past able to arrest this torrent, and that was Canning; and
him the Tories&mdash;idiots that they were, and never discovering
that he was their best friend&mdash;hunted to death with their
besotted and ignorant hostility.</p>

<p>I went to the play last night at a very shabby little house
called the City Theatre&mdash;a long way beyond the Post Office&mdash;to
see Ellen Tree act in a translation of &lsquo;Une Faute,&rsquo;
one of the best pieces of acting I ever saw. This girl
will turn out very good if she remains on the stage. She
has never been brought forward at Covent Garden, and I
heard last night the reason why. Charles Kemble took a
great fancy for her (she is excessively pretty), and made her
splendid offers of putting her into the best parts, and advancing
her in all ways, if she would be propitious to his
flame, but which she indignantly refused; so he revenged
himself (to his own detriment) by keeping her back and
promoting inferior actresses instead. If ever she acquires
fame, which is very probable, for she has as much nature, and
feeling, and passion as I ever saw, this will be a curious
anecdote. [She married Charles Kean, lost her good looks,
and became a tiresome, second-rate actress.]</p>

<h3>August 12th, 1831</h3>

<p>Yesterday a Committee of Council met to
settle the order of the coronation and submit the estimates,
which we have brought under 30,000&#8467;. instead of 240,000&#8467;.,
which they were last time.</p>

<p>The question now is whether our Ministry shall go along
with France, or whether France shall be pulled up; and it
is brought to this point by Leopold&rsquo;s having sent to the
French to thank them for their aid, but to say that he can
do without them, and to beg they will retire, which they
have refused to do. It was known yesterday that they are
at Mons, and strongly suspected they will not so easily be
got out of it; but the French Government will not venture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to quarrel with us if we take a peremptory tone. It is not,
however, clear that the French Government can control the
French army; and I have heard it said that if they had not
ordered the troops to march, the troops would have marched
without orders. L. is all for curbing France; so a very
short time must bring matters to a crisis, and it will be seen
if the Government has authority to check the war party
there. In the meantime the French have taken the Portuguese
ships without any intention of giving them back; and
this our Ministers know, and do not remonstrate. J. asked
L. if it was true, and he said, &lsquo;Oh, yes,&rsquo; for that having been
compelled to force the Tagus, they were placed in a state of
war, and the ships became lawful prizes. If it was not for
Reform I doubt that this Government could stand a moment,
but that will bring them up. In the country it is too clear
that there are no symptoms of a reaction, and if a state of
indifference can be produced it is all that can be hoped and
more than should be expected. I do not think the Government
by any means responsible for the embroiled state of
Europe, but they certainly appear to have no fixed plan or
enlightened view of foreign policy, and if they have not
been to blame hitherto (which in acting with all the Allies,
and endeavouring to keep things quiet, they have not been),
they are evidently in great danger of floundering now.</p>

<h3>Goodwood, August 20th, 1831</h3>

<p>Here I have been a week to-day
for the races, and here I should not be now&mdash;for everybody
else is gone&mdash;if it were not for the gout, which has laid
me fast by the foot, owing to a blow. While on these racing
expeditions I never know anything of politics, and, though I
just read the newspapers, have no anecdotes to record of
Reform or foreign affairs. I never come here without fresh
admiration of the beauty and delightfulness of the place,
combining everything that is enjoyable in life&mdash;large and
comfortable house, spacious and beautiful park, extensive
views, dry soil, sea air, woods, and rides over downs, and all
the facilities of occupation and amusement. The Duke, who
has so strangely become a Cabinet Minister in a Whig
Government, and who is a very good sort of man and my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">REFORM BILL IN DIFFICULTIES.</span>
excellent friend, appears here to advantage, exercising a
magnificent hospitality, and as a sportsman, a farmer, a
magistrate, and good, simple, unaffected country gentleman,
with great personal influence. This is what he is fit for, to
be,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">With safer pride content,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wisest justice on the banks of Trent,</span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">
and not to assist in settling Europe and making new constitutions.</p>

<p>I find on arriving in town that there is nothing new, but
the Bill, which drags its slow length along, is in a bad way;
not that it will not pass the Commons, but now everybody
attacks it, and the press is all against what remains of
it. Lord Chandos&rsquo;s motion and the defeat of Government
by so large a majority have given them a great blow. Still
they go doggedly on, and are determined to cram it down
anyhow, quite indifferent how it is to work and quite ignorant.
As to foreign affairs, the Ministers trust to blunder
through them, hoping, like Sir Abel Handy in the play, that
the fire &lsquo;will go out of itself.&rsquo; Sefton has just been here, who
talks blusteringly of the Peers that are to be made, no matter
at what cost of character to the House of Lords, anything
rather than be beaten; but I am not sure that he <i>knows</i> anything.
In such matters as these he is (however sharp) no better
than a fool&mdash;no knowledge, no information, no reflection or
combination; prejudices, partialities, and sneers are what his
political wisdom consists of; but he is Lord Grey&rsquo;s <i>âme damnée</i>.</p>

<h3>Stoke, August 28th, 1831</h3>

<p>My gout is still hanging on me.
Very strange disorder, affecting different people so differently;
with me very little pain, much swelling, heat, and inconvenience,
more like bruised muscles and tendons and inflamed
joints; it disables me, but never prevents my sleeping at night.
Henry de Ros called on me yesterday; nothing new, and he
knows everything from L., who sits there picking up politics
and gossip, to make money by the one and derive amusement
from the other. L. is odd enough, and very <i>malin</i> with what
he knows. He is against <i>Reform</i>, but not against the <i>Government</i>;
<i>for</i> the Duke of Wellington and not <i>for</i> the Opposition&mdash;in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
short, just as interest, fancy, caprice, and particular partialities
sway him. It was he who told me the fact of the French
having carried away the Portuguese ships, and he said that I
might tell the Duke that he might make what use he pleased
of it; but soon after, wishing if it did come out that it should
fall harmless, he bethought him of the following expedient:&mdash;Seeing
that Valletort (who is a good-natured blockhead) is
always spluttering in the House of Commons, he thought in
his hands it would do no harm, so he told him the fact with
some flattering observations about his activity and energy
in the House, which Valley swallowed and with many thanks
proceeded to put questions to Palmerston, which sure
enough were so confused and unintelligible that nobody
understood him, and the matter fell very flat. I don&rsquo;t see
that Government is saved by this ruse, if the case against
them is a good one; but it is curious as indicative of the
artifice of the person, and of his odd sort of political disposition.
As I don&rsquo;t write history I omit to note such facts as
are recorded in the newspapers, and merely mention the odd
things I pick up, which are not generally known, and which
may hereafter throw some light on those which are.</p>

<p>The Belgian business is subsiding into quiet again. The
Dutch have gained some credit, and the Prince of Orange
has (what was of importance to him) removed the load of
odium under which he had been labouring in Holland, and
acquired great popularity. Leopold has cut a ridiculous
figure enough; not exhibiting any want of personal courage,
but after all the flourishes at the time of his accession
finding himself at the head of a nation of blustering cowards
who would do nothing but run away. The arrival of the
French army soon put an end to hostilities, and now the
greater part of it has been recalled; but Leopold has desired
that 10,000 men may be left for his protection, whether
against the Dutch or against the Belgians does not appear.
This excites considerable jealousies here, for as yet it is not
known <i>why</i> he asked for such aid, nor on what terms it is to
be granted.</p>

<p>L. told me an odd thing connected with these troops.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">TALLEYRAND&rsquo;S CONVERSATION.</span>
Easthope received a commission from a secretary of Soult to
sell largely in our funds, coupled with an assurance that the
troops would <i>not</i> retire. I don&rsquo;t know the fate of the commission.</p>

<p>There are various reports of dissensions in the Cabinet,
which are not true. The Duke of Wellington was sent for by
Lord Grey the other day, to give his opinion about the demolition
of the Belgian fortresses; so the ex-Prime Minister
went to visit his successor in the apartment which was so
lately his own. No man would mind such a thing less than
the Duke; he is sensitive, but has no nonsense about him.
He is very well and, however disgusted with the state of
everything at home and abroad (which after all is greatly
imputable to himself), in high spirits.</p>

<p>The King did a droll thing the other day. The ceremonial
of the coronation was taken down to him for approval.
The homage is first done by the spiritual Peers, with
the Archbishop at their head. The first of each class (the
Archbishop for the spiritual) says the words, and then they
all kiss his cheek in succession. He said he would not be
kissed by the bishops, and ordered that part to be struck
out. As I expected, the prelates would not stand it; the
Archbishop remonstrated, the King knocked under, and so
he must undergo the salute of the spiritual as well as of the
temporal Lords.</p>

<h3>August 30th, 1831</h3>

<p>Left Stoke yesterday morning; a large
party&mdash;Talleyrand, De Ros, Fitzroy Somersets, Motteux, John
Russell, Alava, Byng. In the evening Talleyrand discoursed,
but I did not hear much of him. I was gouty and could not
stand, and all the places near him were taken. I have
never heard him narrate comfortably, and he is difficult to
understand. He talked of Franklin. I asked him if he was
remarkable in conversation; he said he was from his great
simplicity and the evident strength of his mind. He spoke of
the coronation of the Emperor Alexander. Somebody wrote
him a letter at the time from Moscow with this expression:
&lsquo;L&rsquo;Empereur marchait, précédé des assassins de son grand-père,
entouré de ceux de son père, et suivi par les siens.&rsquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
He said of the Count de Saint-Germain (whom he never saw)
that there is an account of him in Craufurd&rsquo;s book; nobody
knew whence he came nor whither he went; he appeared
at Paris suddenly, and disappeared in the same way, lived in
an <i>hôtel garni</i>, had always plenty of money, and paid for everything
regularly; he talked of events and persons connected
with history, both ancient and modern, with entire familiarity
and a correctness which never was at fault, and always of the
people as if he had lived with them and known them; as
Talleyrand exemplified it, he would say, &lsquo;Un jour que je dînais
chez César.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_15_05" id="FNA_15_05"></a><a href="#FN_15_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
He was supposed to be the Wandering Jew, a
story which has always appeared to me a very sublime fiction,
telling of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That settled ceaseless gloom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fabled Hebrew wanderer bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which will not look beyond the tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which cannot hope for rest before.</span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">
Then he related Mallet&rsquo;s conspiracy and the strange way in
which he heard it. Early in the morning his tailor came to
his house and insisted on seeing him. He was in bed, but on his
<i>valet de chambre&rsquo;s</i> telling him how pressing the tailor was he
ordered him to be let in. The man said, &lsquo;Have you not heard
the news? There is a revolution in Paris.&rsquo; It had come to
the tailor&rsquo;s knowledge by Mallet&rsquo;s going to him the very first
thing to order a new uniform! Talleyrand said the conspirators
ought to have put to death Cambacérès and the King of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STATE OF EUROPE AND FRANCE.</span>
Rome. I asked him if they had done so whether he thought
it possible the thing might have succeeded. He said, &lsquo;C&rsquo;est
possible.&rsquo; To my question whether the Emperor would not
have blown away the whole conspiracy in a moment he replied,
&lsquo;Ce n&rsquo;est pas sûr, c&rsquo;est possible que cela aurait réussi.&rsquo;</p>

[This mysterious adventurer died in the arms of Prince Charles of
Hesse, in 1784; and some account of him is to be found in the &lsquo;Memoirs&rsquo; of
that personage, quoted in the &lsquo;Edinburgh Review,&rsquo; vol. cxxiii. p. 521. The
Count de Saint-Germain was a man of science, especially versed in chemistry
botany, and metallurgy. He is supposed to have derived his money from
an invention in the art of dyeing. According to his own account of himself
he was a son of Prince Ragozky of Transylvania and his first wife, a
Tekely, and he was Protestant and educated by the last of the Medicis.
He was supposed to be ninety-two or ninety-three when he died. His
knowledge of the arcana of science and his mysterious manner of life had
given him something of the reputation of a wizard and a conjuror, but he
was an honourable and benevolent man, not to be confounded with such
charlatans as Mesmer and Cagliostro.]</p></div>

<p>He afterwards talked of Madame de Staël and Monti.
They met at Madame de Marescalchi&rsquo;s villa near Bologna, and
were profuse of compliments and admiration for each other.
Each brought a copy of their respective works beautifully
bound to present to the other. After a day passed in an interchange
of literary flatteries, and the most ardent expressions
of delight, they separated, but each forgot to carry away the
present of the other, and the books remain in Madame de
Marescalchi&rsquo;s library to this day.</p>

<h3>August 31st, 1831</h3>

<p>Dined at Osterley yesterday; Lady Sandwich,
Esterhazy and the Bathursts, Brooke Greville and
George Villiers. Esterhazy told me he had no doubt that there
would be a war, that General Baudron was arrived from
Brussels, and Leopold had sent word by him that the French
troops were absolutely necessary to his safety, to protect
him from the turbulence of his own subjects. He considered
that the Polish business was over, at which he greatly rejoiced.
He said that nobody was prepared for war, and the
great object was to gain time, but a few weeks must now
bring matters to a crisis; the only difficulty appears to be what
to go to war about, and who the belligerents should be, for at
the eleventh hour, and with the probability of a general war,
it is a toss-up whether we and the French are to be the closest
allies or the deadliest enemies. He told me that Casimir
Périer would probably be unable to keep his ground, that the
modified law about the House of Peers did not give satisfaction.
If he is beaten on this he goes out, and if he does,
with him will probably vanish all hopes of peace. It is pretty
evident that France is rapidly advancing to a republic. Her
institutions have long been republican, and, though very
compatible with a despotic empire, incompatible with a constitutional
and limited monarchy. This Buonaparte knew.</p>

<p>Another Coronation Committee yesterday, and, I am happy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
to say, the last, for this business is the greatest of all bores.
There is a furious squabble between the Grand Chamberlain
and the Earl Marshal (who is absent and has squabbled by
deputy) about the box of the former in Westminster Abbey.
At the last coronation King George IV. gave Lord Gwydir
<i>his</i> box in addition to his own, and now Lord Cholmondeley
claims a similar
box.<a name="FNA_15_06" id="FNA_15_06"></a><a href="#FN_15_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
This is resisted. The present King
disposes of his own box (and will probably fill it with every
sort of <i>canaille</i>); the Lords won&rsquo;t interfere, and the Grand
Chamberlain protests, and says he has been shamefully used,
and there the matter stands. The Grand Chamberlain is in
the wrong.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_15_06" id="FN_15_06"></a><a href="#FNA_15_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>
[Lord Gwydir and Lord Cholmondeley filled the office of Lord High
Chamberlain for alternative lives as the representatives of the joint claimants
of the office.]</p></div>

<h3>September 3rd, 1831</h3>

<p>On Wednesday a Council was held. Very
few of the Ministers stay for the Councils; small blame to
them, as the Irish say, for we are kept about three times as
long by this regular, punctual King as by the capricious, irregular
Monarch who last ruled over us. This King is a queer
fellow. Our Council was principally for a new Great Seal and
to deface the old Seal. The Chancellor claims the old one as
his perquisite. I had forgotten the hammer, so the King said,
&lsquo;My Lord, the best thing I can do is to give you the Seal, and
tell you to take it and do what you please with it.&rsquo; The
Chancellor said, &lsquo;Sir, I believe there is some doubt whether
Lord Lyndhurst ought not to have half of it, as he was Chancellor
at the time of your Majesty&rsquo;s accession.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said
the King, &lsquo;then I will judge between you like Solomon; here
(turning the Seal round and round), now do you cry heads or
tails?&rsquo; We all laughed, and the Chancellor said, &lsquo;Sir, I take
the bottom part.&rsquo; The King opened the two compartments of
the Seal and said, &lsquo;Now, then, I employ you as ministers of
taste. You will send for Bridge, my silversmith, and desire
him to convert the two halves each into a salver, with my arms
on one side and yours on the other, and Lord Lyndhurst&rsquo;s the
same, and you will take one and give him the other, and
both keep them as presents from me.&rsquo; The Duchess of Kent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ANECDOTES OF GEORGE IV.</span>
will not attend the coronation, and there is a report that the
King is unwilling to make all the Peers that are required;
this is the current talk of the day.</p>

<h3>September 5th, 1831</h3>

<p>At Gorhambury since Saturday; the
Harrowbys, Bathursts, Frankland Lewes&rsquo;s, Lady Jersey,
Mahon, Lushington, Wortleys; rather agreeable and lively;
all anti-Reformers, so no quarrelling about that, though
Lord Harrowby is ready to squabble with anybody either
way, but furiously against the Bill.</p>

<h3>September 8th, 1831</h3>

<p>Dined with the Duke of Wellington
yesterday; thirty-one people, very handsome, and the Styrian
Minstrels playing and singing all dinner time, a thing I
never saw before. I sat next to Esterhazy and talked to him
(a very little) about Belgian affairs. He said Talleyrand
had given positive assurances that the French troops should
be withdrawn whenever the Dutch retired, that the other
Powers were aware of Périer&rsquo;s difficulties, and were ready to
concede much to keep him in power, but that if he had not
sufficient influence to repress the violent war faction there
was no use in endeavouring to support him. Our Government
had behaved very well and had been very strong in
their remonstrances.</p>

<p>After dinner I had much talk with the Duke, who told me
a good deal about the late King and the Duchess of Kent;
talked of his extravagance and love of spending, provided
that it was not his own money that he spent; he told an old
story he had heard of Mrs. Fitzherbert&rsquo;s being obliged to
borrow money for his post-horses to take him to Newmarket,
that not a guinea was forthcoming to make stakes for some
match, and when on George
Leigh&rsquo;s<a name="FNA_15_07" id="FNA_15_07"></a><a href="#FN_15_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
entreaty he allowed
some box to be searched that 3,000&#8467;. was found in it. He
always had money. When he died they found 10,000&#8467;. in
his boxes, and money scattered about everywhere, a great deal
of gold. There were about 500 pocket-books, of different
dates, and in every one money&mdash;guineas, one pound notes, one,
two, or three in each. There never was anything like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
quantity of trinkets and trash that they found. He had
never given away or parted with anything. There was a
prodigious quantity of hair&mdash;women&rsquo;s hair&mdash;of all colours and
lengths, some locks with the powder and pomatum still
sticking to them, heaps of women&rsquo;s gloves, <i>gages d&rsquo;amour</i>
which he had got at balls, and with the perspiration still
marked on the fingers, notes and letters in abundance, but
not much that was of any political consequence, and the
whole was destroyed. Of his will he said that it was made in
1823 by Lord Eldon, very well drawn, that he desired his executors
might take all he had to pay his debts and such legacies
as he might bequeath in any codicils he should make. He
made no codicils and left no debts, so the King got all as
heir-at-law. Knighton had managed his affairs very well,
and got him out of debt. A good deal of money was
disbursed in charity, a good deal through the medium of two
or three old women. The Duke, talking of his love of ordering
and expense, said that when he was to ride at the last coronation
the King said, &lsquo;You must have a very fine saddle.&rsquo;
&lsquo;What sort of saddle does your Majesty wish me to have?&rsquo;
&lsquo;Send Cuffe to me.&rsquo; Accordingly Cuffe went to him, and the
Duke had to pay some hundreds for his saddle. (While I
am writing the King and Queen with their <i>cortége</i> are passing
down to Westminster Abbey to the coronation, a grand
procession, a fine day, an immense crowd, and great acclamations.)</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_15_07" id="FN_15_07"></a><a href="#FNA_15_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[Colonel George Leigh, who managed his race-horses; he was married
to Lord Byron&rsquo;s half-sister.]</p></div>

<p>We then talked of the Duchess of Kent, and I asked
him why she set herself in such opposition to the Court. He
said that Sir John Conroy was her adviser, that he was sure
of it. What he then told me throws some light upon her
ill-humour and displays her wrong-headedness. In the first
place the late King disliked her; the Duke of Cumberland
too was her enemy, and George IV., who was as great a
despot as ever lived, was always talking of taking her child
from her, which he inevitably would have done but for the
Duke, who, wishing to prevent quarrels, did all in his power
to deter the King, not by opposing him when he talked of
it, which he often did, but by putting the thing off as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE DUCHESS OF KENT.</span>
as he could. However, when the Duchess of Cumberland
came over, and there was a question how the Royal
Family would receive her, he thought he might reconcile
the Cumberlands to the Duchess of Kent by engaging her
to be civil to the Duchess of Cumberland, so he desired
Leopold to advise his sister (who was in the country) from
him very strongly to write to the Duchess of Cumberland
and express her regret at being absent on her arrival, and so
prevented from calling on her. The Duchess sent Leopold
back to the Duke to ask why he gave her this advice?
The Duke replied that he should not say why, that he
knew more of what was going on than she possibly could,
that he gave her this advice for her own benefit, and again
repeated that she had better act on it. The Duchess said
she was ready to give him credit for the goodness of his
counsel, though he would not say what his reasons were, and
she did as he suggested. This succeeded, and the Duke of
Cumberland ceased to blow the coals. Matters went on
quietly till the King died. As soon as he was dead the
Duchess of Kent wrote to the Duke, and desired that she
might be treated as a Dowager Princess of Wales, with a
suitable income for herself and her daughter, who she also
desired might be treated as Heiress Apparent, and that she
should have the sole control over the allowance to be made
for both. The Duke replied that her proposition was altogether
inadmissible, and that he could not possibly think of
proposing anything for her till the matters regarding the
King&rsquo;s Civil List were settled, but that she might rely
upon it that no measure which affected her in any way
should be considered without being imparted to her and the
fullest information given her. At this it appears she took
great offence, for she did not speak to him for a long time after.</p>

<p>When the Regency Bill was framed the Duke desired the
King&rsquo;s leave to wait upon the Duchess of Kent and show it to
her, to which his Majesty assented, and accordingly he wrote
to her to say he would call upon her the next day with the
draft of the Bill. She was at Claremont, and sent word that
she was out of town, but desired he would send it to her in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
the country. He said she ought to have sent Sir John Conroy
to him, or have desired him to go to her at Claremont,
which he would have done, but he wrote her word that he
could not explain by letter so fully what he had to say as he
could have done in a personal interview, but he would do so
as well as he could. In the meantime, Lord Lyndhurst
brought on the measure in the House of Lords, and she sent
Conroy up to hear him. He returned to Claremont just
after the Duchess had received the Duke&rsquo;s letter. Since that
he has dined with her.</p>

<p>[I must say the King is punctual; the cannon are now
firing to announce his arrival at the Abbey, and my clock is
at the same moment striking eleven; at eleven it was announced
that he would be there.]</p>

<p>His Majesty, I hear, was in great ill-humour at the levee
yesterday; contrary to his usual custom he sent for nobody,
and gave no audiences, but at ten minutes after one flounced
into the levee room; not one Minister was come but the Duke
of Richmond. Talleyrand and Esterhazy alone of the <i>Corps
Diplomatique</i> were in the next room. He attacked the officer
of the Guards for not having his cap on his head, and sent
for the officer on guard, who was not arrived, at which
he expressed great ire. It is supposed that the peerages
have put him out of temper. His Majesty did a very strange
thing about them. Though their patents are not made out,
and the new Peers are no more Peers than I am, he desired
them to appear as such in Westminster Abbey and do
homage. Colonel Berkeley asked me what he should do, and
said what the King had desired of him. I told him he should
do no such thing, and he said he would go to the Chancellor
and ask him. I don&rsquo;t know how it ended. Howe told me
yesterday morning in Westminster Abbey that Lord Cleveland
is to be a duke, though it is not yet acknowledged if it
be so. There has been a battle about that; they say that he
got his boroughs to be made a marquis, and got rid of them
to be made a
duke.<a name="FNA_15_08" id="FNA_15_08"></a><a href="#FN_15_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3>September 17th, 1831</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A DINNER AT ST. JAMES&rsquo;S.</span>
The coronation went off well, and
whereas nobody was satisfied before it everybody was after it.
No events of consequence. The cholera has got to Berlin, and
Warsaw is taken by the Russians, who appear to have behaved
with moderation. Since the deposition of Skrznecki, and the
reign of clubs and mobs and the perpetration of massacres at
Warsaw, the public sympathy for the Poles has a good deal
fallen off. The cholera, which is travelling south, is less violent
than it was in the north. It is remarkable that the common
people at Berlin are impressed with the same strange belief that
possessed those of St. Petersburg that they have been poisoned,
and Chad writes to-day that they believe there is no such
disease, and that the deaths ascribed to that malady are produced
by poison administered by the doctors, who are bribed
for that purpose; that the rich finding the poor becoming too
numerous to be conveniently governed have adopted this
mode of thinning the population, which was employed with
success by the English in India; that the foreign doctors are
the delegates of a central committee, which is formed in
London and directs the proceedings, and similar nonsense.</p>

<p>The talk of the town has been about the King and a
toast he gave at a great dinner at St. James&rsquo;s the other day.
He had ninety guests&mdash;all his Ministers, all the great people,
and all the foreign Ambassadors. After dinner he made a
long, rambling speech in French, and ended by giving as &lsquo;a
sentiment,&rsquo; as he called it, &lsquo;The land we live in.&rsquo; This was
before the ladies left the room. After they were gone he
made another speech in French, in the course of which he
travelled over every variety of topic that suggested itself to
his excursive mind, and ended with a very coarse toast and
the words &lsquo;Honi soit qui mal y pense.&rsquo; Sefton, who told it me
said he never felt so ashamed; Lord Grey was ready to sink
into the earth; everybody laughed of course, and Sefton, who
sat next to Talleyrand, said to him, &lsquo;Eh bien, que pensez-vous
de cela?&rsquo; With his unmoved, immovable face he answered
only, &lsquo;C&rsquo;est bien remarquable.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In the meantime Reform, which has subsided into a calm
for some time past, is approaching its termination in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
House of Commons, and as it gets near the period of a fresh
campaign, and a more arduous though a shorter one, agitation
is a little reviving. The &lsquo;Times&rsquo; and other violent newspapers
are moving heaven and earth to stir up the country
and intimidate the Peers, many of whom are frightened
enough already. The general opinion at present is that the
Peers created at the coronation will not be enough to carry the
Bill (they are a set of horrid rubbish most of them), but that
no more will be made at present; that the Opposition, if
united, will be strong enough to throw out the Bill, but that
they are so divided in opinion whether to oppose the Bill on
the second reading or in Committee that this dissension will
very likely enable it to pass. Up to this time there has been
no meeting, and nothing has been agreed upon, but there
would have been one convened by the Duke of Wellington
but for Lady Mornington&rsquo;s death, and this week they will
arrange their plan of operations. From what Sefton says
(who knows and thinks only as Brougham and Grey direct
him) I conclude that the Government are resolved the Bill
shall pass, that if it is thrown out they will do what the
Tories recommended, and make as many Peers as may be
sufficient, for he said the other day he would rather it was
thrown out on the second reading than pass by a small
majority. With this resolution (which after having gone
so far is not unwise) and the feeling out of doors, pass it
must, and so sure are Government of it that they have begun
to divide the counties, and have set up an office with clerks,
maps, &amp;c., in the Council Office, and there the Committee sit
every day.</p>

<h3>Stoke, September 18th, 1831</h3>

<p>I came here yesterday with the
Chancellor, Creevey, Luttrell, my father and mother, Esterhazy,
Neumann. Brougham was tired, never spoke, and went
to bed early. This morning I got a letter from the Lord President
enclosing an order from the King for a copy of the
proceedings in Council on the marriage of the Duke of
Sussex and Lady Augusta Murray. The Chancellor told me
that the young man Sir Augustus d&rsquo;Este had behaved very
ill, having filed a bill in Chancery, into which he had put all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STATE OF FRANCE.</span>
his father&rsquo;s love letters, written thirty years ago, to perpetuate
evidence; that it was all done without the Duke of Sussex&rsquo;s
consent, but that D&rsquo;Este had got Lushington&rsquo;s opinion that
the marriage was valid on the ground that the Marriage
Act only applied to marriages contracted here, whereas
this was contracted at Rome. He said Lushington was a
great authority, but that he had no doubt he was wrong.
The King is exceedingly annoyed at it.</p>

<h3>September 19th, 1831</h3>

<p>Came to town. Talleyrand, Madame de
Dino, and Alava came to Stoke yesterday. Talleyrand had a
circle, but the Chancellor talked too much, and they rather
spoilt one another. He said one neat thing. They were
talking of Madame d&rsquo;Abrantès&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memoirs,&rsquo; and of her mother,
Madame Pernon. My father said, &lsquo;M. de Marb&oelig;uf était
<i>un peu</i> l&rsquo;amant de Madame Pernon, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?&rsquo; He
said, &lsquo;Oui, mais je ne <i>sais pas dans quelles proportions</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>September 20th, 1831</h3>

<p>News arrived of great riots at Paris, on
account of the Polish business and the fall of Warsaw.
Madame de Dino (who, by-the-bye, Talleyrand says is the
cleverest <i>man</i> or <i>woman</i> he ever knew) said last night that
she despaired of the state of things in France, that this was
no mere popular tumult, but part of an organised system of
disaffection, and that the Carlists had joined the ultra-Republicans,
that the National Guard was not to be depended
upon, that &lsquo;leur esprit était fatigué.&rsquo; Talleyrand himself
was very low, and has got no intelligence from his Government.
This morning I met Lord Grey, and walked with
him. I told him what Madame de Dino had said. He said
he knew it all, and how bad things were, and that they would
be much worse if the Reform Bill was thrown out here. I
asked him how they would be affected by that. He said that
a change of Ministry here would have a very bad effect
there, from which it may be inferred that if beaten they
mean to resign. He said the French Ministry had been
very imprudent about Poland. I said, &lsquo;How? for what could
they have done? They could only get at Poland through
Prussia.&rsquo; He said they might have sent a fleet to the
Baltic with our concurrence, though we could not urge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
them to do so. I asked him what he thought would be the
result of the dissolution of Périer&rsquo;s Government; I said that
there appeared to me two alternatives, a general <i>bouleversement</i>
or the war faction in power under the existing system. He
replied he did not think there would now be a <i>bouleversement</i>,
but a Ministry of Lafayette, Lamarque, and all that party
who were impatient to plunge France into war. I said I did
not think France could look to a successful war, for the old
alliance would be re-formed against her. He rejoined that
Russia was powerless, crippled by this contest, and under the
necessity of maintaining a great army in Poland; Austria
and Prussia were both combustible, half the provinces of the
former nearly in a state of insurrection; that the latter had
enough to do to preserve quiet, and the French would rouse all
the disaffected spirit which existed in both. I said &lsquo;then we
were on the eve of that state of things which was predicted
by Canning in his famous speech.&rsquo; Here we met Ellis, and I
left them.</p>

<p>I afterwards saw George Villiers, who told me that he
knew from a member of the Cabinet that there had been a
division in it on the question of going out if the Reform
Bill should be rejected, and that it had been carried by
a majority that they should. He told me also a curious
thing about Stanley&rsquo;s Arms Bill: that it had never been imparted
to Lord Anglesey, nor to the Cabinet here, and that
Lord Grey had been obliged to write an apology to Lord
Anglesey, and to tell him he (Lord Grey) had himself seen the
Bill for the first time in the newspapers. This he had from
Lord C., who is a great friend of Lord Anglesey&rsquo;s, and who
had seen Lord Grey&rsquo;s letter before he left Ireland; but the
story appears to me quite incredible, and is probably untrue.</p>

<h3>September 22nd, 1831</h3>

<p>The night before last Croker and Macaulay
made two fine speeches on Reform; the former spoke
for two hours and a half, and in a way he had never done
before. Macaulay was very brilliant. There was a meeting
at Lord Ebrington&rsquo;s yesterday, called by him, Lyttelton
Lawley, and of members of the House of Commons only, and
they (without coming to any resolution) were all agreed to
prevail on the Government not to resign in the event of
the Reform Bill being rejected in the House of Lords. I
have no doubt, therefore, in spite of what Lord Grey said,
and the other circumstances I have mentioned above, that
they will not resign, and I doubt whether there will be any
occasion for it.</p>

<p>There was a dinner at Apsley House yesterday; the
Cabinet of Opposition, to discuss matters before having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
a general meeting. At this dinner there were sixteen
or seventeen present, all the leading anti-Reformers of the
Peers. They agreed to oppose the second reading. Dudley,
who was there, told me it was tragedy first and farce
afterwards; for Eldon and Kenyon, who had dined with
the Duke of Cumberland, came in after dinner. Chairs
were placed for them on each side of the Duke, and after
he had explained to them what they had been discussing, and
what had been agreed upon, Kenyon made a long speech on
the first reading of the Bill, in which it was soon apparent
that he was very drunk, for he talked exceeding nonsense,
wandered from one topic to another, and repeated the same
things over and over again. When he had done Eldon
made a speech on the second reading, and appeared to be
equally drunk, only, Lord Bathurst told me, Kenyon in his
drunkenness talked nonsense, but Eldon sense. Dudley said
it was not that they were as drunk as lords and gentlemen
sometimes are, but they were drunk like porters. Lyndhurst
was not there, though invited. He dined at Holland House.
It is pretty clear, however, that he will vote for the second
reading, for his wife is determined he shall. I saw her
yesterday, and she is full of pique and resentment against
the Opposition and the Duke, half real and half pretended,
and chatters away about Lyndhurst&rsquo;s not being their cat&rsquo;s
paw, and that if they choose to abandon him, they must not
expect him to sacrifice himself for them. The pretexts
she takes are, that they would not go to the House of Lords
on Tuesday and support him against Brougham on the
Bankruptcy Bill, and that the Duke of Wellington wrote to
her and <i>desired</i> her to influence her husband in the matter
of Reform. The first is a joke, the second there might be
a little in, for vanity is always uppermost, but they have
both some motive of interest, which they will pursue in whatever
way they best can. The excuse they make is that they
want to conceal their strength from the Government, and
accordingly the Duke of Wellington has not yet entered any
of his proxies. The truth is that I am by no means sure
<i>now</i> that it is safe or prudent to oppose the second reading;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PROSPECTS OF THE REFORM BILL.</span>
and though I think it very doubtful if any practicable alteration
will be made in Committee, it will be better to take
that chance, and the chance of an accommodation and compromise
between the two parties and the two Houses, than
to attack it in front. It is clear that Government are resolved
to carry the Bill, and equally clear that no means they
can adopt would be unpopular. They are averse to making
more Peers if they can help it, and would rather go quietly
on, without any fresh changes, and I believe they are conscientiously
persuaded that this Bill is the least democratical
Bill it is possible to get the country to accept, and that if
offered in time this one will be accepted. I had heard
before that the country is not enamoured of this Bill, but I
fear that it is true that they are only indifferent to the
Conservative clauses of it (if I may so term them), and for
that reason it may be doubtful whether there would not be
such a clamour raised in the event of the rejection of this
Bill as would compel the Ministers to make a new one, more
objectionable than the old. If its passing clearly appears to be
inevitable, why, the sooner it is done the better, for at least
one immense object will be gained in putting an end to
agitation, and restoring the country to good-humour, and
it is desirable that the House of Lords should stand as well
with the people as it can. It is better, as Burke says, &lsquo;to do
early, and from foresight, that which we may be obliged to
do from necessity at last.&rsquo; I am not more delighted with
Reform than I have ever been, but it is the part of prudence
to take into consideration the present and the future, and
not to harp upon the past. It matters not how the country
has been worked up to its present state, if a calm observation
convinces us that the spirit that has been raised cannot be
allayed, and that is very clear to me.</p>

<h3>September 24th, 1831</h3>

<p>Peel closed the debate on Thursday
night with a very fine speech, the best (one of his opponents
told me, and it is no use asking the opinions of friends if a
candid opponent is to be found) he had ever made, not only
on that subject, but on any other; he cut Macaulay to
ribands. Macaulay is very brilliant, but his speeches are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
harangues and never replies; whereas Peel&rsquo;s long experience
and real talent for debate give him a great advantage in the
power of reply, which he very eminently possesses. Macaulay,
however, will probably be a very distinguished man. These
debates have elicited a vast deal of talent, and have served
as touchstones to try real merit and power. As a proof of
what practice and a pretty good understanding can do, there
is Althorp, who now appears to be an excellent leader, and
contrives to speak decently upon all subjects, quite as much
as a leader need do; for I have always thought that it should
not be his business to furnish rhetoric and flowers of eloquence,
but good-humour, judgment, firmness, discretion,
business-like talents, and gentlemanlike virtues.</p>

<p>Dined at Richmond on Friday with the Lyndhursts; the
<i>mari</i> talks against the Bill, the women for it. They are like
the old divisions of families in the Civil Wars.</p>

<p>My brother-in-law and sister are just returned from a tour
of three weeks in Holland; curious spectacle, considering the
state of the rest of Europe, nothing but loyalty and enthusiasm,
adoration of the Orange family; 2,000,000 of people,
and an army of 110,000 men; everybody satisfied with the
Government, and no desire for Reform.</p>

<p>Paris, on the point of exploding, is again tranquil, but
nobody can tell for how long. They bet two to one here
that the Reform Bill is thrown out on the second reading;
and what then? The meeting at Ebrington&rsquo;s was flat, nothing
agreed on. Hume wanted to pass some violent resolution,
but was overruled. Milton made a foolish speech, with
prospective menaces and present nothingness in it, and
they separated without having done good or harm.</p>

<h3>Newmarket, October 1st, 1831</h3>

<p>Came here last night, to my great
joy, to get holidays, and leave Reform and cholera and politics
for racing and its amusements. Just before I came away I met
Lord Wharncliffe, and asked him about his interview with
Radical Jones. This blackguard considers himself a sort of
chief of a faction, and one of the heads of the <i>sans-culottins</i>
of the present day. He wrote to Lord Wharncliffe and said
he wished to confer with him, that if he would grant him an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PROSPECTS OF THE REFORM BILL.</span>
interview he might bring any person he pleased to witness
what passed between them. Lord Wharncliffe replied that
he would call on him, and should be satisfied to have no
witness. Accordingly he did so, when the other in very civil
terms told him that he wished to try and impress upon his
mind (as he was one of the heads of anti-Reform in the
House of Lords) how dangerous it would be to reject this
Bill, that all sorts of excesses would follow its rejection, that
their persons and properties would be perilled, and resistance
would be unavailing, for that they (the Reformers) were resolved
to carry their point. Lord Wharncliffe asked whether
if this was conceded they would be satisfied. Jones replied,
&lsquo;Certainly not;&rsquo; that they must go a great deal further,
that an hereditary peerage was not to be defended on any
reasonable theory. Still, he was not for doing away with it,
that he wished the changes that were inevitable to take
place quietly, and without violence or confusion. After
some more discourse in this strain they separated, but very
civilly, and without any intemperance of expression on the
part of the Reformer.</p>

<p>On Monday the battle begins in the House of Lords, and
up to this time nobody knows how it will go, each party being
confident, but opinion generally in favour of the Bill being
thrown out. There is nothing more curious in this question
than the fact that it is almost impossible to find anybody who
is satisfied with the part he himself takes upon it, and that it
is generally looked upon as a choice of evils, in which the
only thing to do is to choose the least. The Reformers say,
You had better pass the Bill or you will have a worse. The
moderate anti-Reformers would be glad to suffer the second
reading to pass and alter it in Committee, but they do not
dare do so, because the sulky, stupid, obstinate High Tories
declare that they will throw the whole thing up, and not
attempt to alter the Bill if it passes the second reading.
Every man seems tossed about by opposite considerations
and the necessity of accommodating his own conduct to the
caprices, passions, and follies of others.</p>

<h3>Riddlesworth, October 10th, 1831</h3>

<p>At Newmarket all last week;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
all the Peers absent; here since Friday. Yesterday morning
the newspapers (all in
black<a name="FNA_16_01" id="FNA_16_01"></a><a href="#FN_16_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>)
announced the defeat of the
Reform Bill by a majority of forty-one, at seven o&rsquo;clock on
Saturday morning, after five nights&rsquo; debating. By all
accounts the debate was a magnificent display, and incomparably
superior to that in the House of Commons, but
the reports convey no idea of it. The great speakers on
either side were:&mdash;Lords Grey, Lansdowne, Goderich,
Plunket, and the Chancellor, for the Bill; against it,
Lords Wharncliffe (who moved the amendment), Harrowby,
Carnarvon, Dudley, Wynford, and Lyndhurst. The Duke of
Wellington&rsquo;s speech was exceedingly bad; he is in fact, and
has proved it in repeated instances, unequal to argue a great
constitutional question. He has neither the command of
language, the power of reasoning, nor the knowledge requisite
for such an effort. Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s speech was
amazingly fine, and delivered with great effect; and the last
night the Chancellor is said to have surpassed all his former
exploits, Lyndhurst to have been nearly as good, and Lord
Grey very great in reply. There was no excitement in
London the following day, and nothing particular happened
but the Chancellor being drawn from Downing Street to
Berkeley Square in his carriage by a very poor mob. The
majority was much greater than anybody expected, and it
is to be hoped may be productive of good by showing the
necessity of a compromise; for no Minister can make sixty
Peers, which Lord Grey must do to carry this Bill; it
would be to create another House of Lords. Nobody knows
what the Ministers would do, but it was thought they would
not resign. A meeting of members of the House of Commons
was held under the auspices of Ebrington to agree
upon a resolution of confidence in the Government this day.
The majority and the magnificent display of eloquence and
ability in the House of Lords must exalt the character and
dignity of that House, and I hope increase its efficacy for
good purposes and for resistance to this Bill. It may be
hoped, too, that the apathy of the capital may have some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DORSETSHIRE ELECTION.</span>
effect in the country, though the unions, which are so well
disciplined and under the control of their orators, will make
a stir. On the whole I rejoice at this result, though I had
taken fright before, and thought it better the Bill should be
read a second time than be thrown out by a very small
majority.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_16_01" id="FN_16_01"></a><a href="#FNA_16_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[Not all of them; neither the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; nor the &lsquo;Morning Herald.&rsquo;]</p></div>

<p>While the debates have been going on there have been
two elections, one of the Lord Mayor in the City, which the
Reformers have carried after a sharp contest, and the contest
for Dorsetshire between Ponsonby and Ashley, which is not
yet over. Ponsonby had a week&rsquo;s start of his opponent,
notwithstanding which it is so severe that they have been for
some days within ten or fifteen of each other, and (what is
remarkable) the anti-Reformer is the popular candidate, and
has got all the mob with him. This certainly is indicative
of some <i>change</i>, though not of a <i>reaction</i>, in public opinion.
There is no longer the same vehemence of desire for this Bill,
and I doubt whether all the efforts of the press will be able
to stimulate the people again to the same pitch of excitement.</p>

<h3>Buckenham, October 11th, 1831</h3>

<p>Came here yesterday; nobody
of note, not lively, letters every day with an account of what
is passing. The Radical press is moving heaven and earth to
produce excitement, but without much effect. There was
something of a mob which marched about the parks, but no
mischief done. Londonderry and some others were hooted
near the House of Lords. Never was a party so crestfallen
as I hear they are; they had not a notion of such a division.
There seems to be a very general desire to bring about a
fair compromise, and to have a Bill introduced next session
which may be so framed as to secure the concurrence of
the majority of both Houses. The finest speeches by all
accounts were Harrowby&rsquo;s, Lyndhurst&rsquo;s, and Grey&rsquo;s reply;
but Henry de Ros, who is a very good judge, writes me
word that Lyndhurst&rsquo;s was the most to his taste.</p>

<h3>October 12th, 1831</h3>

<p>The Reformers appear to have rallied their
spirits. Lord Grey went to Windsor, was graciously received
by the King, and obtained the dismissal of Lord Howe, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
will serve to show the King&rsquo;s entire good-will to his present
Ministers. Ebrington&rsquo;s resolution of confidence was carried
by a great majority in the House of Commons after some
violent speeches from Macaulay, Sheil, and O&rsquo;Connell, and very
moderate ones and in a low tone on the other side. Macaulay&rsquo;s
speech was as usual very eloquent, but as inflammatory
as possible. Such men as these three can care nothing into
what state of confusion the country is thrown, for all they
want is a market to which they may bring their
talents;<a name="FNA_16_02" id="FNA_16_02"></a><a href="#FN_16_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
but how the Miltons, Tavistocks, Althorps, and all who
have a great stake in the country can run the same course
is more than I can conceive or comprehend. Party is indeed,
as Swift says, &lsquo;the madness of many,&rsquo; when carried to its
present pitch. In the meantime the Conservative party are
as usual committing blunders, which will be fatal to them.
Lord Harrowby was to have moved yesterday or the day
before, in the House of Lords, a resolution pledging the
House to take into consideration early in the next session
the acknowledged defects in the representation, with a view
to make such ameliorations in it as might be consistent with
the Constitution, or something to this effect. This has not
been done because the Duke of Wellington objects. He will
not concur because he thinks the proposition should come
from Government; as if this was a time to stand upon such
punctilios, and that it was not of paramount importance to
show the country that the Peers are not obstinately bent
upon opposing all Reform. I had hoped that he had profited
by experience, and that at least his past errors in politics
might have taught him a little modesty, and that he would
not have thwarted measures which were proposed by the
wisest and most disinterested of his own party. I can conceive
no greater misfortune at this moment than such a disunion
of that party, and to have its deliberations ruled by
the obstinacy and prejudices of the Duke. He is a great
man in little things, but a little man in great matters&mdash;I
mean in civil affairs; in those mighty questions which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD GREY AND BISHOP PHILLPOTTS.</span>
embrace enormous and various interests and considerations,
and to comprehend which great knowledge of human nature,
great sagacity, coolness, and impartiality are required, he is
not fit to govern and direct. His mind has not been sufficiently
disciplined, nor saturated with knowledge and matured
by reflection and communication with other minds, to
enable him to be a safe and efficient leader in such times as
these.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_16_02" id="FN_16_02"></a><a href="#FNA_16_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
This was very unjust to Macaulay, and not true as to Sheil; to O&rsquo;Connell
alone applicable.</p></div>

<p>[In reading over these remarks upon the Duke of Wellington,
and comparing them with the opinions I now entertain
of his present conduct, and of the nature and quality of
his mind, I am compelled to ask myself whether I did not
then do him injustice. On the whole I think not. He is
not, nor ever was, a little man in anything, great or small;
but I am satisfied that he has made great political blunders,
though with the best and most patriotic intentions, and that
his conduct throughout the Reform contest was one of the
greatest and most unfortunate of them.&mdash;<i>July 1838.</i>]</p>

<h3>October 14th, 1831</h3>

<p>The town continues quite quiet; the
country nearly so. The press strain every nerve to produce
excitement, and the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; has begun an assault on the
bishops, whom it has marked out for vengeance and defamation
for having voted against the Bill. Althorp and Lord John
Russell have written grateful letters to Attwood as Chairman
of the Birmingham Union, thus indirectly acknowledging
that puissant body. There was a desperate strife in the
House of Lords between Phillpotts and Lord Grey, in which
the former got a most tremendous dressing. Times must
be mightily changed when my sympathies go with this
bishop, and even now, though full of disgust with the other
faction, I have a pleasure in seeing him trounced. The
shade of Canning may rejoice at the sight of Grey smiting
Phillpotts. Even on such a question Phillpotts was essentially
in the right; but he lost his temper, floundered, and got
punished. It was most indecent and disgusting to hear
Brougham from the Woolsack, in a strain of the bitterest
irony and sarcasm, but so broad as to be without the semblance
of disguise, attack the bench of bishops. I am of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
opinion that it would have been far better never to have let
them back into the House of Lords, but now that they are
there I would not thrust them out, especially at this moment.
Lord Grey in this debate gave no handle certainly, for he
interposed in their favour, and rebuked Lord Suffield, who
attacked them first, and told him he was out of order, and
then Phillpotts very foolishly attacked him.</p>

<h3>October 15th, 1831</h3>

<p>A furious attack in the House of Commons
upon Althorp&rsquo;s and John Russell&rsquo;s letters to Attwood by
Hardinge and Vyvyan. Peel not there, having hopped off to
Staffordshire, to the great disgust of his party, whom he
never scruples to leave in the lurch. They made wretched
excuses for these letters, and could only have recourse to the
pretence of indignation at being thought capable of fomenting
disorders, which is all very well; but they do foment
discord and discontent by every means in their power. With
a yelling majority in the House, and a desperate press out
of it, they go on in their reckless course without fear or
shame. Lord Harrowby made a speech in the House of
Lords, and declared his conviction that the time was come
for effecting a Reform, and that he would support one to a
certain extent, which he specified. In the House he was
coolly received, and the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; hardly deigned to notice
what he said. Parliament is to be up on Thursday next,
and will probably not meet till January, when of course
the first thing done will be to bring in the Bill again. What,
then, is gained? For as Ministers take every opportunity of
declaring that they will accept nothing less efficient (as
they call it) than the present Bill, no compromise can be
looked for. Lord Harrowby is the only man who has said
what he will do, and probably he goes further than the bulk
of his party would approve of; and yet he is far behind the
Ministerial plan. So that there seems little prospect of
getting off for less than the old Bill, for the Opposition will
hardly venture to stop the next <i>in limine</i> as they did this.
I do not see why they should hope to amend the next Bill in
Committee any more than the last, and the division which
they dreaded the other day is not less likely, and would not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DANGERS OF REFORM.</span>
be less fatal upon another occasion. If, then, it is to pass at
last, it comes back to what I thought before, that it might as
well have passed at first as at last, and the excitement consequent
on its rejection have been spared, as well as the
odium which has accrued to the Peers, which will not be
forgotten or laid aside.</p>

<p>The Dorsetshire election promises to end in favour of
Ashley, and there will be a contest for Cambridgeshire, which
may also end in favour of the anti-Reform candidate. These
victories I really believe to be unfortunate, for they are
taken (I am arguing as if they were won, though, with regard
to the first, it is the same thing by contrast with the last
election) by the Tories and anti-Reform champions as
undoubted proofs of the reaction of public opinion, and they
are thereby encouraged to persevere in opposition under the
false notion that this supposed reaction will every day gain
ground. I wish it were so with all my soul, but believe it
is no such thing, and that although there may be fewer
friends to <i>the Bill</i> than there were, particularly among the
agriculturists, Reform is not a whit less popular with the mass
of the people in the manufacturing districts, throughout the
unions, and generally amongst all classes and in all parts of
the country. When I see men, and those in very great
numbers, of the highest birth, of immense fortunes, of
undoubted integrity and acknowledged talents, zealously and
conscientiously supporting this measure, I own I am lost in
astonishment, and even doubt; for I can&rsquo;t help asking
myself whether it is possible that such men would be the
advocates of measures fraught with all the peril we ascribe to
these, whether we are not in reality mistaken, and labouring
under groundless alarm generated by habitual prejudices
and erroneous calculations. But often as this doubt comes
across my mind, it is always dispelled by a reference to and
comparison of the arguments on both sides, and by the
lessons which all that I have ever read and all the conclusions
I have been able to draw from the study of history
have impressed on my mind. I believe these measures full
of danger, but that the manner in which they have been introduced,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
discussed, defended, and supported is more dangerous
still. The total unsettlement of men&rsquo;s minds, the bringing
into contempt all the institutions which have been hitherto
venerated, the aggrandisement of the power of the people,
the embodying and recognition of popular authority, the use
and abuse of the King&rsquo;s name, the truckling to the press, are
things so subversive of government, so prejudicial to order
and tranquillity, so encouraging to sedition and disaffection,
that I do not see the possibility of the country settling down
into that calm and undisturbed state in which it was before
this question was mooted, and without which there can be no
happiness or security to the community. A thousand mushroom
orators and politicians have sprung up all over the
country, each big with his own ephemeral importance, and
every one of whom fancies himself fit to govern the nation.
Amongst them are some men of active and powerful minds,
and nothing is less probable than that these spirits of mischief
and misrule will be content to subside into their original
nothingness, and retire after the victory has been gained
into the obscurity from which they emerged.</p>

<h3>Newmarket, October 23rd, 1831</h3>

<p>Nothing but racing all this
week; Parliament has been prorogued and all is quiet. The
world seems tired, and requires rest. How soon it will
all begin again God knows, but it will not be suffered to sleep
long.</p>

<h3>London, November 11th, 1831</h3>

<p>Nothing written for a long
time; I went after the second October meeting to Euston,
and from thence to Horsham, returned to Newmarket, was
going to Felbrigg, but came to town on Tuesday last (the
8th) on account of the cholera, which has broken out at Sunderland.
The country was beginning to slumber after the
fatigues of Reform, when it was rattled up by the business of
Bristol,<a name="FNA_16_03" id="FNA_16_03"></a><a href="#FN_16_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
which for brutal ferocity and wanton, unprovoked
violence may vie with some of the worst scenes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RIOTS AT BRISTOL.</span>
French Revolution, and may act as a damper to our national
pride. The spirit which produced these atrocities was generated
by Reform, but no pretext was afforded for their actual
commission; it was a premature outbreaking of the thirst for
plunder, and longing after havoc and destruction, which is
the essence of Reform in the mind of the mob. The details
are ample, and to be met with everywhere; nothing could
exceed the ferocity of the populace, the imbecility of the
magistracy, or the good conduct of the troops. More punishment
was inflicted by them than has been generally known,
and some hundreds were killed or severely wounded by the
sabre. One body of dragoons pursued a rabble of colliers
into the country, and covered the fields and roads with the
bodies of wounded wretches, making a severe example of
them. In London there would probably have been a great
uproar and riot, but fortunately Melbourne, who was frightened
to death at the Bristol affair, gave Lord Hill and
Fitzroy Somerset <i>carte blanche</i>, and they made such a provision
of military force in addition to the civil power that the
malcontents were paralysed. The Bristol business has done
some good, inasmuch as it has opened people&rsquo;s eyes (at least
so it is said), but if we are to go on as we do with a mob-ridden
Government and a foolish King, who renders himself
subservient to all the wickedness and folly of his Ministers,
where is the advantage of having people&rsquo;s eyes open, when
seeing they will not perceive, and hearing they will not
understand? Nothing was wanting to complete our situation
but the addition of physical evil to our moral plague, and
that is come in the shape of the cholera, which broke out at
Sunderland a few days ago. To meet the exigency Government
has formed another Board of Health, but without dissolving
the first, though the second is intended to swallow up
the first and leave it a mere nullity. Lord Lansdowne, who
is President of the Council, an office which for once promises
not to be a sinecure, has taken the opportunity to go to
Bowood, and having come up (sent for express) on account of
the cholera the day it was officially declared really to be that
disease, he has trotted back to his house in the country.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_16_03" id="FN_16_03"></a><a href="#FNA_16_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[Riots broke out with great violence at Bristol on the 29th of October,
the pretext being the entry of Sir Charles Wetherell into that city (of which
he was Recorder), who was notorious for his violent opposition to the
Reform Bill. Much property was destroyed, and many lives lost.]</p></div>

<h3>November 14th, 1831</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
For the last two or three days the reports
from Sunderland about the cholera have been of a doubtful
character. The disease makes so little progress that the
doctors begin again to doubt whether it is the Indian
cholera, and the merchants, shipowners, and inhabitants,
who suffer from the restraints imposed upon an infected
place, are loudly complaining of the measures which have
been adopted, and strenuously insisting that their town is in
a more healthy state than usual, and that the disease is no
more than what it always is visited with every year at this
season. In the meantime all preparations are going on in
London, just as if the disorder was actually on its way to the
metropolis. We have a Board at the Council Office, between
which and the Board at the College some civilities have
passed, and the latter is now ready to yield up its functions
to the former, which, however, will not be regularly constituted
without much difficulty and many jealousies, all owing
to official carelessness and mismanagement. The Board has
been diligently employed in drawing up suggestions and instructions
to local boards and parochial authorities, and great
activity has prevailed here in establishing committees for the
purpose of visiting the different districts of the metropolis, and
making such arrangements as may be necessary in the event
of sickness breaking out. There is no lack of money or
labour for this end, and one great good will be accomplished
let what will happen, for much of the filth and misery of the
town will be brought to light, and the condition of the poorer
and more wretched of the inhabitants can hardly fail to be
ameliorated. The reports from Sunderland exhibit a state
of human misery, and necessarily of moral degradation, such
as I hardly ever heard of, and it is no wonder, when a great
part of the community is plunged into such a condition
(and we may fairly suppose that there is a gradually
mounting scale, with every degree of wretchedness up to the
wealth and splendour which glitter on the surface of society),
that there should be so many who are ripe for any desperate
scheme of revolution. At Sunderland they say there are
houses with 150 inmates, who are huddled five and six in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">OVERTURES FOR A COMPROMISE.</span>
a bed. They are in the lowest state of poverty. The sick in
these receptacles are attended by an apothecary&rsquo;s boy, who
brings them (or I suppose tosses them) medicines without
distinction or enquiry.</p>

<p>I saw Lord Wharncliffe last night, just returned from
Yorkshire; he gives a bad account of the state of the public
mind; he thinks that there is a strong revolutionary spirit
abroad; told me that the Duke of Wellington had written to
the King a memorial upon the danger of the associations
that were on foot.</p>

<h3>Roehampton, November 19th, 1831</h3>

<p>On Tuesday last I went
with the Duke of Richmond to pass a day at Shirley Lodge,
a house that has been lent him by Mr. Maberly, and there
we had a great deal of conversation about Reform and
general politics, in the course of which I was struck by
his apparent candour and moderation, and when I told him
that nothing would do but a compromise between the parties
he acceded to that opinion, and said that he should like
to go to Lord Wharncliffe, and talk the matter over with
him. This was on Wednesday. Yesterday morning I
called on Lord Wharncliffe, and told him what Richmond
had said. He was sitting before a heap of papers, and when
I told him this he laughed and said that Richmond was
behindhand, that matters had gone a great deal further than
this, and then proceeded to give me the following account of
what had passed. A short time ago Palmerston spoke to his
son, John Wortley, and expressed a desire that some compromise
could be effected between the Government and the
Opposition leaders, which John imparted to Lord Harrowby
and his father. The overture was so well received by them
that Stanley went to Sandon, Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s place in
Staffordshire, in his way to Ireland, with Lord Grey&rsquo;s
consent, to talk it over with Lord Sandon. After this Lord
Wharncliffe went to Sandon, and the two fathers and
two sons discussed the matter, and came to a sort of
general resolution as to the basis on which they would treat,
which they drew up, and which Wharncliffe read to me. It
was moderate, temperate, embraced ample concessions, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
asserted the necessity of each party refraining from demanding
of the other what either was so pledged to as to be
unable to concede without dishonour. On Wharncliffe&rsquo;s
return to town he again saw Palmerston, and communicated
to him Harrowby&rsquo;s concurrence in an equitable adjustment
of the Reform question, and then suggested that if Government
really desired this, it would be better that he (Wharncliffe)
should see Lord Grey himself on the subject. Palmerston
told Lord Grey, who assented, and gave Wharncliffe a
rendezvous at East Sheen on Wednesday last. There they
had a long conversation, which by his account was conducted
in a very fair and amicable spirit on both sides, and they
seem to have come to a good understanding as to the
principle on which they should treat. On parting, Grey
shook hands with him twice, and told him he had not felt so
much relieved for a long time. The next day Lord Grey
made a minute of their conversation, which he submitted to
the Cabinet; they approved of it, and he sent it to Wharncliffe
to peruse, who returned it to Lord Grey. In this
state the matter stood yesterday morning, apparently with
every prospect of being arranged. Wharncliffe had already
spoken to Dudley, Lyndhurst, and De Ros, the only Peers of
his party he had seen, and to the Archbishop of Canterbury,
who were all delighted at what had passed. He had written
to the Duke of Wellington and Peel, and he is busying
himself in consulting and communicating with all the Peers
and influential Commoners of the party whom he can find in
town. The terms are not settled, but the general basis
agreed upon seems to be this: the concession of Schedule A,
of representatives to the great towns, and a great extension
of the county representation on one side; the abandonment,
or nearly so, of Schedule B, such an arrangement with
regard to the 10&#8467;. qualification as shall have the practical
effect of a higher rate, and an understanding that the
manufacturing interest is not to have a preponderating
influence in the county representation; a great deal to be
left open to discussion, especially on all the subordinate
points.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">NEGOTIATION WITH THE WAVERERS.</span>
Such is the history of this curious transaction, which
affords a triumphant justification of the course which
the Opposition adopted; indeed, Palmerston admitted to
Wharncliffe that their tactics had been entirely judicious.
It is likewise a great homage rendered to character, for
Wharncliffe has neither wealth, influence, nor superior
abilities, nor even popularity with his own party. He is a
spirited, sensible, zealous, honourable, consistent country
gentleman; their knowledge of his moderation and integrity
induced Ministers to commit themselves to him, and he will
thus be in all probability enabled to render an essential
service to his country, and be a principal instrument in the
settlement of a question the continued agitation of which
would have been perilous in the extreme. Besides the prospect
of a less objectionable Bill, an immense object is gained
in the complete separation of the Ministry from the subversive
party, for their old allies the Radicals will never forgive
them for this compromise with the anti-Reformers, and they
have now no alternative but to unite with those who call
themselves the Conservative party against the rebels, republicans,
associators, and all the disaffected in the country.
After all their declarations and their unbending insolence, to
have brought down their pride to these terms, and to the
humiliation of making overtures to a party whose voice was
only the other day designated by John Russell as &lsquo;the
whisper of a faction,&rsquo; shows plainly how deeply alarmed they
are at the general state of the country, and how the conflagration
of Bristol has suddenly illuminated their minds. That
incident, the language of the associations, the domiciliary
visits to Lord Grey at midnight of Place and his rabble, and
the licentiousness of the press, have opened their eyes, and
convinced them that if existing institutions are to be preserved
at all there is no time to be lost in making such an arrangement
as may enable all who have anything to lose to
coalesce for their mutual safety and protection. Whatever
may be the amount of their concessions, the Radicals will
never pardon Lord Grey for negotiating with the Tories at
all, and nothing will prevent his being henceforward the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
object of their suspicion and aversion, and marked out for
their vengeance. By what process Althorp and John Russell
were induced to concur, and how they are to set about swallowing
their own words, I do not guess.</p>

<p>As a proof of the disposition which exists, and the good
understanding between Wharncliffe and the Government, he
told me that some time ago Ward and Palmer went to him,
and said that in the City the majority of men of weight and
property were favourable to Reform, but not to the late Bill,
and that they were desirous of having a declaration drawn
up for signature, expressive of their adherence to Reform, but
of their hope that the next measure might be such as would
give satisfaction to all parties. Wharncliffe drew this up
(there was likewise an acknowledgment of the right of the
House of Lords to exercise their privileges as they had done)
and gave it to them. It is gone to be signed, having been
previously submitted to Grey and Althorp, who approved
of it.</p>

<h3>November 21st, 1831</h3>

<p>Came to town from Roehampton yesterday
morning, saw Henry de Ros, who had seen
Barnes<a name="FNA_16_04" id="FNA_16_04"></a><a href="#FN_16_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
the evening before, and opened to him the pending negotiation.
His rage and fury exceeded all bounds. He swore Brougham
and Grey (particularly the former) were the greatest of
villains. After a long discussion he agreed to try and persuade
his colleagues to adopt a moderate tone, and not to
begin at once to <i>jeter feu et flamme</i>. Henry&rsquo;s object was to
persuade him, if possible, that the interest of the paper will
be in the long run better consulted by leaning towards the
side of order and quiet than by continuing to exasperate
and inflame. He seemed to a certain degree moved by this
argument, though he is evidently a desperate Radical. Henry
went to Melbourne afterwards, who is most anxious for the
happy consummation of this affair, but expressed some alarm
lest they should be unable to agree upon the details. There
is an article in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; this morning of half-menacing
import, sulkily and gloomily written, but not ferocious, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PROCLAMATION AGAINST THE UNIONS.</span>
leaving it open to them to take what line they think fit. In
the afternoon I met Melbourne, who told me they were going
to put forth a proclamation against &lsquo;Attwood and the Birmingham
fellows,&rsquo; which was grateful to my ears.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_16_04" id="FN_16_04"></a><a href="#FNA_16_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[Then editor of the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; newspaper.]</p></div>

<h3>November 22nd, 1831</h3>

<p>The King came to town yesterday for a
Council, at which the meeting of Parliament on the 6th of
December was settled. The proclamation against the unions
(which was not ready, and the King signed a blank) and some
orders about cholera were despatched. Lord Grey told me
that the union had already determined to dissolve itself.</p>

<p>My satisfaction was yesterday considerably damped by
what I heard of the pending negotiation concerning Reform.
Agar Ellis at Roehampton talked with great doubt of its
being successful, which I attributed to his ignorance of what
had passed, but I fear it is from his knowledge that the
Government mean, in fact, to give up nothing of importance.
George Bentinck came to me in the morning, and told me he
had discovered from the Duke of Richmond that the concessions
were not only to be all one way, but that the altered
Bill would be, in fact, more objectionable than the last, inasmuch
as it is more democratic in its tendency, so much so
that Richmond is exceedingly dissatisfied himself, for he has
always been the advocate of the aristocratic interest in the
Cabinet, and has battled to make the Bill less adverse to it.
Now he says he can contend no longer, for he is met by the
unanswerable argument that their opponents are ready to
concede more. I own I was alarmed, and my mind misgave
me when I heard of the extreme satisfaction of Althorp
and Co.; and I always dreaded that Wharncliffe, however
honest and well-meaning, had not calibre enough to conduct
such a negotiation, and might be misled by his vanity. He
bustles about the town, chatting away to all the people he meets,
and I fear is both ignorant himself of what he is about and
involuntarily deceiving others too; he is in a fool&rsquo;s paradise.
I spoke to Henry de Ros about this last night, who seemed
by no means aware of it, and it is difficult to believe that
Lyndhurst and Harrowby should not be perfectly alive to all
the consequences of Wharncliffe&rsquo;s proceedings, or that they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
would sanction them if they had really the tendency that
George Bentinck gives me to understand.</p>

<p>The cholera, which is going on (but without greatly
extending itself) at Sunderland, has excited an unusual alarm,
but it is now beginning to subside. People seeing that it
does not appear elsewhere take courage, but the preparations
are not relaxed, and they are constantly enforced by the
Central Board of Health (as it is called), which is established
at the Council Office, and labours very assiduously in the
cause. Undoubtedly a great deal of good will be done in
the way of purification. As to the disorder, if it had not
the name of cholera nobody would be alarmed, for many an
epidemic has prevailed at different times far more fatal than
this. On Friday last we despatched Dr. Barry down to
Sunderland with very ample powers, and to procure information,
which it is very difficult to get. Nothing can be more
disgraceful than the state of that town, exhibiting a lamentable
proof of the practical inutility of that diffusion of knowledge
and education which we boast of, and which we fancy
renders us so morally and intellectually superior to the rest
of the world. When Dr. Russell was in Russia, he was disgusted
with the violence and prejudices he found there on
the part of both medical men and the people, and he says he
finds just as much here. The conduct of the people of
Sunderland on this occasion is more suitable to the barbarism
of the interior of Africa than to a town in a civilised country.
The medical men and the higher classes are split into parties,
quarrelling about the nature of the disease, and perverting
and concealing facts which militate against their respective
theories. The people are taught to believe that there is
really no cholera at all, and that those who say so intend
to plunder and murder them. The consequence is prodigious
irritation and excitement, an invincible repugnance
on the part of the lower orders to avail themselves of any of
the preparations which are made for curing them, and a
proneness to believe any reports, however monstrous and
exaggerated. In a very curious letter which was received
yesterday from Dr. Daur, he says (after complaining of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISAPPOINTMENT.</span>
medical men, who would send him no returns of the cases of
sickness) it was believed that bodies had been dissected
before the life was out of them, and one woman, was said to
have been cut up while she was begging to be spared. The
consequence of this is that we have put forward a strong
order to compel medical men to give information, and another
for the compulsory removal of nuisances. It is, however,
rather amusing that everybody who has got in their vicinity
anything disagreeable, or that they would like to be rid of,
thinks that now is their time, and the table of the Board of
Health is covered with applications of this nature, from every
variety of person and of place.</p>

<h3>November 23rd, 1831</h3>

<p>Dr. Barry&rsquo;s first letter from Sunderland
came yesterday, in which he declares the identity of the
disease with the cholera he had seen in Russia. He describes
some cases he had visited, exhibiting scenes of misery and
poverty far exceeding what one could have believed it possible
to find in this country; but we who float on the surface of
society know but little of the privations and sufferings which
pervade the mass. I wrote to the Bishop of Durham, to the
chief magistrates, and sent down 200&#8467;. to Colonel Creagh
(which Althorp immediately advanced) to relieve the immediate
and pressing cases of distress.</p>

<p>Saw George Bentinck in the afternoon, who confirmed
my apprehension that Wharncliffe had been cajoled into a
negotiation which Government intended should end by
getting all they want. Richmond, Grey, and Palmerston
were in a minority of three in the Cabinet for putting off
the meeting of Parliament. One of the most Radical of the
Cabinet is Goderich. Such a thing it is to be of feeble
intellect and character, and yet he is a smart speaker, and
an agreeable man. The moderate party are Richmond, who
cannot have much weight, Stanley, who is in Ireland, Lansdowne,
who is always &lsquo;gone to Bowood,&rsquo; Palmerston, and
Melbourne. Yet I am led to think that if Wharncliffe had
insisted on better conditions, and held out, he would have
got them, and that the Cabinet were really disposed to
make all the concessions they could without compromising
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
themselves. The meeting in the City yesterday was a total
failure. Henry Drummond, who is mad, but very clever, and
a Reformer, though for saving the rotten boroughs, spoke
against the declaration, some others followed him, and after
a couple of hours wasted in vain endeavours to procure
unanimity the meeting broke up, and nothing was done. I
saw Wharncliffe last night, who was exceedingly disappointed.</p>

<h3>November 28th, 1831</h3>

<p>The negotiation with Wharncliffe goes
on languidly; he wrote to Lord Grey the other day, and
suggested some heads as the basis of an accommodation,
consisting of some extension of Schedule B, excluding town
voters from county voting, and one or two other points;
to which Lord Grey replied that some of the things he
mentioned might be feasible, but that there would be great
difficulty about others, that he feared nothing might come of
their communications, as he would not hear of any other
Peers who were disposed to go along with him. It is not a
bad thing that they should each be impressed with a salutary
apprehension, the one that he will have the same difficulties
to encounter in the House of Lords, the other that nobody
will follow him, for it will render an arrangement more probable
than if they both thought they had only to agree
together, and that the rest must follow as a matter of course.
The Duke of Wellington has written again to Wharncliffe,
declining altogether to be a party to any negotiation. De
Ros told me that he never saw such a letter as Peel&rsquo;s&mdash;so
stiff, dry, and reserved, just like the man in whom great
talents are so counteracted, and almost made mischievous, by
the effects of his cold, selfish, calculating character. In the
meantime the state of the country is certainly better, the
proclamation putting down the unions has been generally
obeyed, the press has suspended its fury, and the approach
of the meeting of Parliament seems to have calmed the
country to a great degree. The event most to be desired
is that the Government may carry their Bill quietly through
the House of Commons, amendments be carried in the Committee
of the House of Lords, and upon these there may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POULETT THOMSON.</span>
a compromise, though after all it is impossible not to have
a secret misgiving that the alterations which appear desirable
may prove to be mischievous, for it is the great evil
of the measure that being certainly new no human being
can guess how it will work, or how its different parts will
act upon one another, and what result they will produce.</p>

<p>There seems to be a constant sort of electrical reciprocity
of effort between us and France just now. The three days
produced much of our political excitement, and our Bristol
business has been acted with great similarity of circumstance
at Lyons, and is still going on. Talleyrand produced the
&lsquo;Moniteur&rsquo; last night with the account, lamented that the
Duc d&rsquo;Orléans had been sent with Marshal Soult to Lyons,
which he said was unnecessary and absurd, that Soult was
the best man for the purpose of putting it down. It was
begun by the workpeople, who were very numerous, not
political in its objects, but the cries denoted a mixture of
everything, as they shouted &lsquo;Henri V., Napoléon II, La
République, and Bristol.&rsquo; He was at Lady Holland&rsquo;s, looking
very cadaverous, and not very talkative, talked of Madame
du Barri, that she had been very handsome, and had some
remains of beauty up to the period of her death; of Luckner,
who was guillotined, and as the car passed on the people
cried (as they used), &lsquo;À la guillotine! à la guillotine!&rsquo;
Luckner turned round and said, &lsquo;<i>On</i> y va, canaille.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We have just sent a commission to Paris to treat with
the French Government about a commercial treaty on
the principles of free trade. Poulett Thomson, who has
been at Paris some time, has originated it, and Althorp
selected George Villiers for the purpose, but has added to him
as a colleague Dr. Bowring, who has in fact been selected by
Thomson, a theorist, and a jobber, deeply implicated in the
&lsquo;Greek Fire,&rsquo; and a Benthamite. He was the subject of a
cutting satire of Moore&rsquo;s, beginning,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The ghost of Miltiades came by night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood by the bed of the Benthamite;</span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em">
but he has been at Paris some time, understanding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
subject, and has wound himself into some intimacy with
the French King and his Ministers. It is, however, Poulett
Thomson who has persuaded Althorp to appoint him, in
order to have a creature of his own there.</p>

<p>I have never been able to understand the enormous
unpopularity of this man, who appears civil, well-bred, intelligent,
and agreeable (only rather a coxcomb), and has
made a certain figure in the House of Commons, but it has
been explained to me by a person who knows him well.
He was originally a merchant, and had a quantity of
counting-house knowledge. He became member of a club
of political economists, and a scholar of M&lsquo;Culloch&rsquo;s. In
this club there were some obscure but very able men, and by
them he got crammed with the principles of commerce and
political economy, and from his mercantile connections he
got facts. He possessed great industry and sufficient ability
to work up the materials he thus acquired into a very
plausible exhibition of knowledge upon these subjects, and
having opportunities of preparing himself for every particular
question, and the advantage of addressing an audience the
greater part of which is profoundly ignorant, he passed for
a young gentleman of extraordinary ability and profound
knowledge, and amongst the greatest of his admirers was
Althorp, who, when the Whigs came in, promoted him to his
present situation. Since he has been there he has not had
the same opportunities of learning his lesson from others
behind the curtain, and the envy which always attends success
has delighted to pull down his reputation, so that he now
appears something like the jackdaw stripped of the peacock&rsquo;s
feathers.</p>

<h3>November 30th, 1831</h3>

<p>Went to breakfast at the Tower, which
I had never seen. Dined with Lady Holland, first time for
seven years, finished the quarrel, and the last of that batch;
they should not last for ever. In the morning Wharncliffe
came to me from Lord Grey&rsquo;s, with whom he had had a final
interview. He showed me the paper he gave Grey containing
his proposals, which were nearly to this effect: conceding
what the Government required, with these exceptions and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WHARNCLIFFE&rsquo;S PROPOSAL.</span>
counter-concessions, an alteration in Schedule B with a
view to preserve in many cases the two members; that
voters for the great manufacturing towns should have votes
for the counties; that London districts should not have so
many representatives; that when the franchise was given
to great manufacturing towns, <i>their</i> county should not have
more representatives; that corporate rights should be saved,
though with an infusion of 10&#8467;. voters where required; that
Cheltenham and Brighton (particularly) should have no
members. These were the principal heads, proposed in a
paper of moderate length and civil expression. Grey said
the terms were inadmissible, that some parts of his proposal
might be feasible, but the points on which Wharncliffe most
insisted (London, and town and county voting) he could
not agree to. So with many expressions of civility and
mutual esteem they parted. He is disappointed, but not dejected,
and I tried to persuade him that an arrangement on
this basis is not less probable than it was.</p>

<p>The fact is it would have been nearly impossible for
Government to introduce a Bill so different from the first as
these changes would have made it, as the result of a negotiation.
They would have been exposed to great obloquy, and
have had innumerable difficulties to encounter, but if the Bill
goes into a Committee of the Lords, and the other clauses
pass without opposition, the Government may not think
themselves obliged to contest these alterations. I think the
Government would accept them, and probably they feel that
in no other way could they do so. It seems to me that the
success of these amendments depends now very much upon
the Opposition themselves, upon their firmness, their union,
and above all their reasonableness. Saw Talleyrand last
night, who said they had better news from Lyons, that there
was nothing political in it. News came yesterday morning
that the cholera had broken out at Marseilles.</p>

<h3>December 3rd, 1831</h3>

<p>Wharncliffe showed me his correspondence
with the Duke of Wellington on this negotiation.
They differed greatly, but amicably enough, though I take
it he was not very well pleased with Wharncliffe&rsquo;s last letter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
in which he distinctly told the Duke that his speech on the
Address, and declaration against any Reform, was what overthrew
his Government. This he never will admit, and, passing
over the proximate cause, always refers his fall to (what
was certainly the remote cause) the Catholic question&mdash;that
is, to the breaking up of the Tory party which followed it,
and the union of the old Tories with the Whigs and Radicals
on purpose to turn him out. In this correspondence
Wharncliffe has much the best of it, and I was surprised to
find with what tenacity the Duke clings to his cherished
prejudices, and how he shuts his eyes to the signs of the
times and the real state of the country. With the point at
issue he never would grapple. Wharncliffe argued for concession,
<i>because</i> they have not the means of resistance, and
that they are in fact at the mercy of their opponents. The
Duke admitted the force against them, but thought it would
be possible to govern the country without Reform &lsquo;if the
King was not against them&rsquo;&mdash;an important increment of
his conditions; there is no doubt that &lsquo;the King&rsquo;s name is
a tower of strength, which they upon the adverse faction
want&rsquo;&mdash;and he continued through all his letters arguing the
question on its abstract merits, and repeating the topic that
had been over and over again urged, but without reference to
the actual state of things and the means of resistance. It
seems, however, pretty clear that he will oppose this Bill just
as he did the last, and he will probably have a great many
followers; but the party is broken up, for Wharncliffe and
Harrowby will vote for the second reading; the bishops will
generally go with them, and probably a sufficient number of
Peers. If Lord Grey can see a reasonable chance of carrying
the Bill without making Peers, there can be very little doubt
he will put off that resource till the last moment.</p>

<h3>December 4th, 1831</h3>

<p>Dined with Talleyrand yesterday. He
complained to me of Durham&rsquo;s return, and of &lsquo;sa funeste influence
sur Lord Grey:&rsquo; that because he had been at
Brussels and at Paris, he fancied nobody but himself knew
anything of foreign affairs; he praised Palmerston highly.
In the evening to Lady Harrowby, who told me John
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">AN APPEAL FROM LORD CHANCELLOR BROUGHAM.</span>
Russell had been with her, all moderation and candour, and
evidently for the purpose of keeping alive the amicable relations
which had been begun by Wharncliffe&rsquo;s negotiation.
When Lady Harrowby said it was over, he replied, &lsquo;For the
present,&rsquo; said how glad he should be of a compromise, hinted
that Sandon might be instrumental, that he might move an
amendment in the House of Commons; abused Macaulay&rsquo;s
violent speech&mdash;in short, was all mild and <i>doucereux</i>&mdash;all
which proves that they <i>do</i> wish to compromise if they could
manage it conveniently. Lord John Russell told her that there
was no going on with Durham, that he never left Lord Grey,
tormented his heart out, and made him so ill and irritable
that he could not sleep. Durham wanted to be Minister for
Foreign Affairs.</p>

<h3>December 7th, 1831</h3>

<p>Parliament opened yesterday; not a bad
speech, though wordy and ill-written. There was an oversight
in the Address, which was corrected in both Houses by
Peel and Lord Harrowby, but not taken <i>as an amendment</i>.
Lord Grey begged it might be inserted in Lord Camperdown&rsquo;s
address, which was done. It was about the King of
Holland and the treaty. The Address says that they rejoice
<i>at the treaty</i>, whereas there is none at present. Lord
Lyttelton made a very foolish speech, and was very well cut
up by Lord Harrowby, and Peel spoke well in the other
House.</p>

<h3>December 8th, 1831</h3>

<p>At Court yesterday to swear in
Erskine,<a name="FNA_16_05" id="FNA_16_05"></a><a href="#FN_16_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Brougham&rsquo;s new Chief Judge in Bankruptcy and Privy
Councillor. The Chancellor is in a great rage with me. There
is an appeal to the Privy Council from a judgment of his
(in which he was wrong), the first appeal of the kind for above
a hundred
years;<a name="FNA_16_06" id="FNA_16_06"></a><a href="#FN_16_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
I told him it was ready to be heard, and
begged to know if he had any wish as to who should be
summoned to hear it. He said very tartly, &lsquo;Of course I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
have somebody to hear it <i>with me</i>.&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Do you mean to
hear it yourself, then?&rsquo; &lsquo;And pray why not? don&rsquo;t I hear
appeals from myself every day in the House of Lords? didn&rsquo;t
you see that I could not hear a case the other day because
Lord Lyndhurst was not there? I have <i>a right</i> to hear it.
I sit there as a Privy Councillor.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;you have
certainly <i>a right</i> if you choose it.&rsquo; &lsquo;You may rely upon it I
shall do nothing unusual in the Privy Council,&rsquo; and then he
flounced off in high dudgeon. I told Lord Lansdowne afterwards,
who said he should not allow it to be heard by <i>him</i>,
and should make a point of summoning all the great law
authorities of the Privy Council. This was the case of
Drax <i>v.</i> Grosvenor, which excited great interest, in which
Brougham tried to play all sorts of tricks to prevent his
judgment being reversed, which tricks I managed to defeat,
and the judgment was reversed, as is described farther
on. I never had the advantage of seeing the Chancellor
before in his sulks, though he is by no means unfrequently
in them, very particularly so this time last year, when he
was revolving in his mind whether he should take the Great
Seal, and when he thought he was ill-used, so Auckland told
me.</p>

<p>The cholera is on the decline at Sunderland, but in the
meantime our trade will have been put under such restrictions
that the greatest embarrassments are inevitable. Intelligence
is already come that the Manchester people have
curtailed their orders, and many workmen will be out of
work. Yesterday a deputation from Coventry came to
Auckland, and desired a categorical answer as to whether
Government meant to resume the prohibitory system, because
if they would not the glove trade at Coventry would discharge
their workmen.</p>

<h3>December 11th, 1831</h3>

<p>Yesterday Harrowby had an interview
with Lord Grey, the result of which I do not know; walked
with Stuart (de Rothesay) in the morning, who had seen the
Duke of Wellington the day before. I said I was afraid he
was very obstinate. He said &lsquo;No, he thought not, but that
the Duke fancied Wharncliffe had gone too far.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE SECOND REFORM BILL.</span>
To-morrow the Reform Bill comes on. Some say that it
will be as hotly disputed as ever, and that Peel&rsquo;s speeches indicate
a bitterness undiminished, but this will not happen. It
is clear that the general tone and temper of parties is softened,
and though a great deal of management and discretion is
necessary to accomplish anything like a decent compromise,
the majority of both parties are earnestly desirous of bringing
the business to an end by any means. What has
already taken place between the Government and Wharncliffe
and Harrowby has certainly smoothed the way, and
removed much of that feeling of asperity which before existed.
The press, too, is less violent, the &lsquo;Morning Herald&rsquo;
openly preaching a compromise, and the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; taking that
sort of sweep which, if it does not indicate a change, shows
a disposition to take such a position as may enable it to adopt
any course.</p>

<p><i>In the evening</i>.&mdash;Called on Lord Bathurst in the morning;
met him going out, and stopped to talk to him. He
knew of the meeting in Downing Street; that Lords Harrowby,
Wharncliffe, and Chandos were to meet the Chancellor
and Lords Althorp and Grey; that Chandos had gone to
Brighton, ostensibly to talk to the King about the West
Indies, but had taken the opportunity to throw in something
on the topic of Reform; that the King desired him to speak
to Palmerston, and allowed him to say that he did so by his
orders. (The King, it seems, knows nothing of what is going
on, for he reads no newspapers and the Household tell him
nothing.) Accordingly Chandos did speak to Palmerston,
and the result was a note to him, begging these three would
meet the three Ministers above mentioned. Lady Harrowby
told me that they went. Brougham did not arrive till the
conference was nearly over. There was an abundant interchange
of civilities, but nothing concluded, the Ministers
declining every proposition that Lord Harrowby made to
them, though Lord Grey owned that they did not ask for
anything which involved an abandonment of the principle of
the Bill. They are, then, not a bit nearer an accommodation
than they were before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
George Bentinck told me this evening of a scene which had
been related to him by the Duke of Richmond, that lately took
place at a Cabinet dinner; it was very soon after Durham&rsquo;s
return from abroad. He was furious at the negotiations and
question of compromise. Lord Grey is always the object of
his rage and impertinence, because he is the only person
whom he dares attack. After dinner he made a violent <i>sortie</i>
on Lord Grey (it was at Althorp&rsquo;s), said he would be eternally
disgraced if he suffered any alterations to be made in this
Bill, that he was a betrayer of the cause, and, amongst
other things, reproached him with having kept him in town
on account of this Bill in the summer, &lsquo;and thereby having
been the cause of the death of his son.&rsquo; Richmond said in
his life he never witnessed so painful a scene, or one which
excited such disgust and indignation in every member of the
Cabinet. Lord Grey was ready to burst into tears, said he
would much rather work in the coal-mines than be subject
to such attacks, on which the other muttered, &lsquo;and you
might do worse,&rsquo; or some such words. After this Durham
got up and left the room. Lord Grey very soon retired too,
when the other Ministers discussed this extraordinary scene,
and considered what steps they ought to take. They thought
at first that they should require Durham to make a public
apology (i.e. before all of them) to Lord Grey for his impertinence,
which they deemed due to <i>them</i> as he was <i>their</i> head,
and to <i>Althorp</i> as having occurred in his house, but as
they thought it was quite certain that Durham would resign
the next morning, and that Lord Grey might be pained at
another scene, they forbore to exact this. However, Durham
did not resign; he absented himself for some days from the
Cabinet, at last returned as if nothing had happened, and
there he goes on as usual. But they are so thoroughly disgusted,
and resolved to oppose him, that his influence is
greatly impaired. Still, his power of mischief and annoyance
is considerable. Lord Grey succumbs to him, and they
say in spite of his behaviour is very much attached to him,
though so incessantly worried that his health visibly suffers
by his presence. There is nothing in which he does not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONFESSION OF A BODY-SNATCHER.</span>
meddle. The Reform Bill he had a principal hand in concocting,
and he fancies himself the only man competent to
manage our foreign relations. Melbourne, who was present
at this scene, said, &lsquo;If I had been Lord Grey, I would have
knocked him down.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>December 13th, 1831</h3>

<p>Lord John Russell brought on his Bill last
night in a very feeble speech. A great change is apparent
since the last Bill; the House was less full, and a softened
and subdued state of temper and feeling was evinced. Peel
made an able and a bitter speech, though perhaps not a very
judicious one. There are various alterations in the Bill;
enough to prove that it was at least wise to throw out the
last. Althorp, who answered Peel, acknowledged that if the
old Bill had been opposed in its earliest stage it never could
have been brought forward again, or made an avowal to that
effect. In fact, Peel is now aware (as everybody else is)
of the enormous fault that was committed in not throwing it
out at once, before the press had time to operate, and rouse
the country to the pitch of madness it did. On what trifles
turn the destinies of nations! William Bankes told me last
night that Peel owned this to him; said that he had earnestly
desired to do so, but had been turned from his purpose by
Granville Somerset! And why? Because he (in the expectation
of a dissolution) must have voted against him, he said,
in order to save his popularity in his own county.</p>

<p>Met Melbourne at Lord Holland&rsquo;s; they were talking of
a reported confession to a great extent of murders, which is
said to have been begun and not finished, by the Burkers, or
by one of them. Melbourne said it was true, that he began the
confession about the murder of a black man to a Dissenting
clergyman, but was interrupted by the ordinary. Two of a
trade could not agree, and the man of the Established
Church preferred that the criminal should die unconfessed,
and the public uninformed, rather than the Dissenter should
extract the truth. Since writing this I see Hunt put a
question to George Lamb on this point, and he replied that
he knew nothing of any other confession, which is not true.
I have heard, but on no authority, that some surgeons are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
so disagreeably implicated that they choose to conceal these
horrors.</p>

<h3>December 14th, 1831</h3>

<p>People generally are mightily satisfied
at the tone of the discussion the other night, and, what is of
vast importance, the press has adopted a moderate and conciliatory
tone, even the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; which, is now all for compromise.
It is clear as daylight that the Government will
consent to anything which leaves untouched the great
principles of the Bill, and the country desires to see the
question settled, and, if possible, rest from this eternal
excitement.</p>

<h3>December 20th, 1831</h3>

<p>The second reading of the Reform Bill
was carried at one o&rsquo;clock on Saturday night by a majority
of two to one, and ended very triumphantly for Ministers,
who are proportionately elated, and their opponents equally
depressed. Croker had made a very clever speech on Friday,
with quotations from Hume, and much reasoning upon them.
Hobhouse detected several inaccuracies, and gave his discovery
to Stanley, who worked it up in a crushing attack
upon Croker. It is by far the best speech Stanley ever
made, and so good as to raise him immeasurably in the
House. Lord Grey said it placed him at the very top of
the House of Commons, without a rival, which perhaps is
jumping to rather too hasty a conclusion. He shone the more
from Peel&rsquo;s making a very poor exhibition. He had been so
nettled by Macaulay&rsquo;s sarcasms the night before on his tergiversation,
that he went into the whole history of the Catholic
question and his conduct on that occasion, which, besides
savouring of that egotism with which he is so much and
justly reproached, was uncalled for and out of place. The
rest of his speech was not so good as usual, and he did not
attempt to answer Stanley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PANSHANGER.</span>
Distress seems to increase
hereabouts, and crime with it. Methodism and saintship
increase too. The people of this house are examples of the
religion of the fashionable world, and the charity of natural
benevolence, which the world has not spoiled. Lady Cowper
and her family go to church, but scandalise the congregation
by always arriving half an hour too late. The hour matters
not; if it began at nine, or ten, or twelve, or one o&rsquo;clock, it
would be the same thing; they are never ready, and always
late, but they go. Lord Cowper never goes at all; but he employs
multitudes of labourers, is ready to sanction any and
every measure which can contribute to the comfort and happiness
of the peasantry. Lady Cowper and her daughters inspect
personally the cottages and condition of the poor. They
visit, enquire, and give; they distribute flannel, medicines,
money, and they talk to and are kind to them, so that the
result is a perpetual stream flowing from a real fountain of
benevolence, which waters all the country round and gladdens
the hearts of the peasantry, and attaches them to those from
whom it emanates.</p>

<h3>Panshanger, January 6th, 1832</h3>

<p>Talleyrand, Dino, Palmerston,
Esterhazy, came yesterday and went away to-day&mdash;that
is, the two first and the Seftons did. There has been
another contest in the Cabinet about the Peers, which has
ended in a sort of compromise, and five are to be made
directly, two new ones and three eldest sons called up. Old
Talleyrand came half-dead from the conferences, which
have been incessant these few days, owing to the Emperor of
Russia&rsquo;s refusal to ratify the treaty and the differences about
the Belgian fortresses. One conference lasted eleven hours
and a quarter, and finished at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>

<h3>Gorhambury, January 7th, 1832</h3>

<p>Came here to-day. Berkeley
Paget and Lushington; nobody else. Had a conversation
with Lady C. before I came away; between Palmerston,
Frederick Lamb, and Melbourne she knows everything, and
is a furious anti-Reformer. The upshot of the matter is this:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the question about the Peers is still under discussion;
Lord Grey and the ultra party want to make a dozen, <i>now</i>,
the others want only to yield five or six. Lord Grey wrote
to Palmerston saying the King had received his proposition
(about the Peers) very well, but desired to have his reasons
in writing, and to-day at twelve there was to be another
Cabinet on the subject, in order probably that the &lsquo;reasons&rsquo;
might go down by the post. The moderate party in the
Cabinet consists of Lansdowne, Richmond, Palmerston,
Melbourne, and Stanley. Palmerston and Melbourne, particularly
the latter, are now heartily ashamed of the part
they have taken about Reform. They detest and abhor the
whole thing, and they find themselves unable to cope with
the violent party, and consequently implicated in a continued
series of measures which they disapprove; and they do not
know what to do, whether to stay in and fight this unequal
battle or resign. I told her that nothing could justify their
conduct, and their excuses were good for nothing; but that
there was no use in resigning now. They might still do
some good in the Cabinet; they could do none out of it. In
fact, Durham and the most violent members of the Cabinet
would gladly drive Palmerston and Melbourne to resign if
they could keep Stanley, who is alone of importance of that
squad; but he is of such weight, from his position in the House
of Commons, that if he can be prevailed upon to be staunch,
and to hold out with the moderates against the ultras, the
former will probably prevail. Durham wants to be Minister
for Foreign Affairs, and would plague Lord Grey till he gave
him the seals, unless his other colleagues put a veto upon the
appointment. But the anxiety of the Reformers to make Peers
has not reference to the Reform Bill alone; they undoubtedly
look further, and knowing their own weakness in the House
of Lords, they want to secure a permanent force, which may
make them stronger than their antagonists in that House.
Otherwise they would not be so averse to all questions of
conciliation, express their disbelief in conversions, and
trumpet forth their conviction that any individual of the

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">EFFORTS OF THE MODERATE PARTY.</span>
desire of the moderate party in the Cabinet is that those
who will vote for the second reading shall make haste to
declare their intention, and I have written to Lady Harrowby
to endeavour to get Lord Harrowby to take some such step.
I had already written to De Ros, urging him to speak to
Wharncliffe, and get him to take an opportunity of giving
the King to understand that the necessity for a creation of
Peers is by no means so urgent as his Ministers would have
him believe.</p>

<h3>Panshanger, January 13th, 1832</h3>

<p>Returned here yesterday;
found Melbourne, Lamb, the Lievens, the Haddingtons, Luttrell,
the Ashleys, John Ashley, and Irby. While I was at
Gorhambury I determined to write to Wharncliffe and urge
him to speak to the King, and accordingly I did so. I received
a letter from him saying that De Ros had already
spoken to him, that he had had a conversation with Sir Herbert
Taylor, which he had desired him to repeat to the King
and to Lord Grey, that he had intended to leave the matter
there, but in consequence of my letter he should ask for an
audience. This morning I have heard again from him. He
saw the King, and was with him an hour; put his Majesty in
possession of his sentiments, and told him there would be no
necessity for creating Peers if the Government would be
conciliatory and moderate in the Committee of the House
of Commons; he promised to tell me the particulars of this
interview when we meet.</p>

<p>Last night Frederick Lamb told me that Lord Grey had
sent word to Melbourne of what Wharncliffe had said to Sir
Herbert Taylor, and Lord Grey assumed the tenour of Wharncliffe&rsquo;s
language to have been merely an advice to the King not
to make Peers, whereas all I suggested to him was to explain
to the King that the creation was not necessary for the reasons
which have been assigned to his Majesty by his Ministers,
viz., the intention of all who voted against the second reading
last year to vote against it this. In the meantime the dispute
has been going on in the Cabinet, time has been gained, and
several incidents have made a sort of cumulative impression.
There is a petition to the King, got up by Lord Verulam and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
Lord Salisbury, which is in fact a moderate Reform manifesto.
It has been numerously signed, and Verulam is going to
Brighton to present it. I have been labouring to persuade him
to make up his mind to vote for the second reading, and to tell
the King that such is his intention, which he has promised
me he will. When I had obtained this promise from him I
wrote word to Lady Cowper, telling her at the same time that
Lord Harris (I had heard) would vote for the second reading,
and this letter she imparted to Melbourne, who stated the
fact in the Cabinet, where it made a considerable impression.
All such circumstances serve to supply arms to the moderate
party.</p>

<p>This morning Melbourne went up to another Cabinet,
armed with another fact with which I supplied him. Lord
Craven declared at his own table that if the Government
made Peers <i>he would not vote with them</i>, and if he was sent
for he should reply that as they could create Peers so easily
they might do without him. All such circumstances as these,
I find, are considered of great importance, and are made
available for the purpose of fighting the battle in the Cabinet.
As to Lord Grey, it is exceedingly difficult to understand his
real sentiments, and to reconcile his present conduct with
the general tenour of his former professions; that he <i>was</i>
averse to the adoption of so violent a measure I have no
doubt&mdash;his pride and aristocratic principles would naturally
make him so&mdash;but he is easily governed, constantly yielding
to violence and intimidation, and it is not unlikely that the
pertinacity of those about him, the interests of his party, and
the prolongation of his power may induce him to sacrifice
his natural feelings and opinions. It is very probable that,
although he may have allowed himself to be at the head of
those who are for the creation, he may have such misgivings
and scruples as may prevent his carrying that point with
the high hand and in the summary way which he might do.</p>

<h3>January 15th, 1832</h3>

<p>This morning Frederick Lamb showed me
a letter he had got from Melbourne to this effect: &lsquo;that they
had resolved to make no Peers at all at present; that to
make a few would be regarded as a menace, and be as bad as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WHARNCLIFFE&rsquo;S INTERVIEW WITH THE KING.</span>
if they made a great many; but that as many as would be
necessary to carry the Bill would be made, if it was eventually
found that it must be so;&rsquo; he added &lsquo;it only remained
for people to come forward and declare their intention of
supporting the second reading.&rsquo; This is certainly a great
victory, and I do believe mainly attributable to our exertions,
to the spirit we have infused into Melbourne himself, and
the use we have made of Wharncliffe and Verulam, and
the different little circumstances we have brought to bear
upon the discussion. What now remains is the most
difficult, but I shall do all I can to engage Peers to take a
moderate determination and to declare it. Lamb told me
that the King has an aversion to making <i>a few</i> Peers,
that he has said he would rather make twenty-five than
five, that whatever he must make he should like to make
at once, and not to have to return to it. Anyhow, time is
gained, and a victory for the moment.</p>

<h3>London, January 20th, 1832</h3>

<p>Came up on Monday last. I
have been changing my house, and so occupied that I have
not had time to write. Wharncliffe came to town on Wednesday,
and came straight to my office to give me an account
of his interview with the King, in which it appears as if he
had said much about what he ought, and no more. He told his
Majesty that the reports which had been circulated as to the
disposition and intentions of himself and his friends, and the
argument for the necessity of making Peers, which he understood
to have been founded on these reports, had compelled
him to ask for this audience, that he wished to explain
to his Majesty that he (Lord Wharncliffe) had no intention
of opposing the second reading of the Reform Bill as he
had done before, that he had reason to believe that many
others would adopt the same course, and if Ministers showed
a moderate and conciliating disposition in the House of
Commons, he was persuaded they would have no difficulty
in carrying the second reading in the House of Lords. He
then implored the King well to consider the consequences of
such a <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i> as this creation of Peers would be; to look
at what had happened in France, and to bear in mind that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
if this was done for one purpose, and by one Government,
the necessity would infallibly arise of repeating it again
by others, or for other objects. He was with the King an
hour dilating upon this theme. The King was extremely
kind, heard him with great patience, and paid him many
compliments, and when he took leave told him that he was
extremely glad to have had this conversation with him. Sir
Herbert Taylor gave Lord Wharncliffe to understand that he
had made an impression, only impressions on the mind of
the King are impressions on sand. However, from Taylor&rsquo;s
cautious hints to him to persevere, it is likely that he did do
good. He is himself persuaded that his audience principally
produced the delay in the creation of Peers.</p>

<p>In the meantime he was not idle at Brighton. Lord Ailesbury,
who saw the King, consulted Wharncliffe, and agreed
at last to tell the King that his sentiments were the same as
those which Lord Wharncliffe had expressed to him, and
Lord Kinnoull and Lord Gage have promised him their
proxies.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning he came to me again, very desponding.
He had found Harrowby in a state of despair,
uncertain what he should do, and looking upon the game as
lost, and he had been with the Duke of Wellington, who was
impracticably obstinate, declaring that nothing should prevent
his opposing a Bill which he believed in his conscience
to be pregnant with certain ruin to the country; that he did
not care to be a great man (he meant by this expression a
man of great wealth and station), and that he could contentedly
sink into any station that circumstances might let
him down to, but he never would consent to be a party
directly or indirectly to such a measure as this, and, feeling
as he did, he was resolved to do his utmost to throw it out,
without regard to consequences. Wharncliffe said he was
quite in despair, for that he knew the Duke&rsquo;s great influence,
and that if he and Harrowby endeavoured to form a party
against his views, they had no chance of making one sufficiently
strong to cope with him. He spoke with great and
rather unusual modesty of himself, and of his inadequacy for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE WAVERERS AND WELLINGTON.</span>
this purpose; that Harrowby might do more, and would have
greater influence, but that he was so undecided and so without
heart and spirit that he would not bestir himself.
However, he acknowledged that nothing else was left to be
done.</p>

<p>In the evening went to Lady Harrowby&rsquo;s, where I found
him and Lord Haddington. We stayed there till near two,
after which Wharncliffe and I walked up and down Berkeley
Square. He was in much better spirits, having had a long
conversation with these two Lords, both of whom he said
were now resolved to sail along with him, and he contemplates
a regular and declared separation from the Duke <i>upon
this question</i>. In the morning he had seen Lyndhurst, who
appeared very undecided, and (Wharncliffe was apprehensive)
rather leaning towards the Duke, but I endeavoured to persuade
him that Lyndhurst was quite sure to adopt upon consideration
the line which appeared most conducive to his
own interest and importance, that he had always a hankering
after being well with Lord Grey and the Whigs, and I well
remembered when the late Government was broken up he
had expressed himself in very unmeasured terms about the
Duke&rsquo;s blunders, and the impossibility of his ever again being
Prime Minister; that with him consistency, character, and
high feelings of honour and patriotism were secondary considerations;
that he relied upon his great talents and his
capacity to render himself necessary to an Administration;
that it was not probable he would like to throw himself (even
to please the Duke) into an opposition to the earnest desire
which the great mass of the community felt to have the
question settled; and that both for him and themselves much
of the difficulty of separating themselves from the Duke
might be avoided by the manner in which it was done. I
entreated him to use towards the Duke every sort of frankness
and candour, and to express regret at the necessity of taking
a different line, together with an acknowledgment of the
purity of the Duke&rsquo;s motives; and if this is done, and if other
people are made to understand that they can separate from
the Duke <i>on this occasion</i> without offending or quarrelling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with him, or throwing off the allegiance to him as their
political leader, many will be inclined to do so; besides, it is
of vital importance, if they do get the Bill into Committee,
to secure the concurrence of the Duke and his adherents in
dealing with the details of it, which can only be effected by
keeping him in good humour. On the whole the thing looks
as well as such a thing can look.</p>

<h3>January 24th, 1832</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning Frederick Lamb came
to me and told me that the question of the Peers was again in
agitation, that the King had agreed to make as many as they
pleased, and had understood Wharncliffe&rsquo;s conversation with
his Majesty not to have contained any distinct assurance that
he would vote for the second reading of the Bill. Our party
in the Cabinet still fight the battle, however, and Stanley (on
whom all depends) is said to be firm, but circumstances may
compel them to give way, and Lord Grey (who is suspected
to have in his heart many misgivings as to this measure),
when left to Durham and Co., yields everything. Under
these circumstances I went to Wharncliffe last night, to persuade
him to declare his intentions without loss of time. He
owned that he had not <i>pledged</i> himself to the King, and he
was frightened to death at the idea of taking this step, lest
it should give umbrage to the Tories, and he should find himself
without any support at all. We went, however, together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to Grosvenor Square, and had a long conference with
Harrowby, whom I found equally undecided.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Tories are full of activity and expectation,
and Lord Aberdeen is going to bring on a motion
about Belgium on Thursday, on which they expect to beat the
Government, not comprehending that a greater evil could not
occur, or a better excuse be afforded them for an immediate
creation; still they have got it into their heads that if they
can beat the Government <i>before</i> the Reform Bill comes on they
will force them to resign. I found Harrowby and Wharncliffe
equally undecided as to the course they should adopt, the
former clinging to the hope that the Peerage question was at
last suspended, that Lord Grey was compunctious, the King
reluctant, and so forth&mdash;Wharncliffe afraid of being abandoned
by those who are now disposed to consult and act with
him, and indisposed to commit himself irretrievably in the
House of Lords. After a long discussion I succeeded in persuading
them that the danger is imminent, that there is no
other chance of avoiding it, and they agreed to hoist their
standard, get what followers they can, and declare in the House
for the second reading without loss of time. Harrowby said
of himself that he was the worst person in the world to conciliate
and be civil, which is true enough, but he has a high
reputation, and his opinion is of immense value. Until they
declare themselves not a step will be made, and if they
cannot gain adherents, why the matter is at an end;
while if their example be followed, there is still a chance of
averting the climax of all evils, the swamping the House
of Lords and the permanent establishment of the power
of the present Government. Wharncliffe is to go to the
Duke of Wellington to-day, to entreat him not to let his
party divide on Aberdeen&rsquo;s motion on Thursday, and Harrowby
will go to the Archbishop to invite his adhesion to
their party. I am very doubtful what success to augur from
this, but it is the only chance, and though the bulk of the
Tory Peers are prejudiced, obstinate, and stupid to the last
degree, there are scattered amongst them men of more
rational views and more moderate dispositions. Sandon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PLANS OF CONCILIATION.</span>
came in while we were there, and expressed precisely the
same opinion that I had been endeavouring to enforce upon
them. He said that in the House of Commons, whence he
was just come, the Government had refused to give way upon
a very reasonable objection, without assigning any reason
(the numbers in Schedule B), that this evinced an unconciliatory
spirit, which was very distressing to those who
wished for a compromise, that Hobhouse came to him after
the debate, and said how anxious he was they should come
to some understanding, and act in a greater spirit of conciliation,
and talked of a meeting of the moderate on either
side, that his constituents were eager for a settlement, and by
no means averse to concession, but that while Peel, Croker,
and others persisted in the tone they had adopted, and
in the sort of opposition they were pursuing, it was quite
impossible for the Government to give way upon anything,
or evince any disposition to make concessions. Sandon said
he had no doubt whatever that if Peel had assumed a different
tone at the beginning of the session the Government would
have been more moderate, and mutual concessions might
have been feasible even in the House of Commons. Hobhouse,
however, said that the alterations, whatever they
might be (and he owned that he should like some), would
come with a better grace in the House of Lords, and this is
what I have all along thought. O&rsquo;Connell arrived yesterday,
took his seat, and announced his intention of supporting
Government at any rate. All the Irish members do the
same, and this great body, that everyone expected would
display hostility to the Bill, have formed themselves into a
phalanx, and will carry it through any difficulties by their
compactness and the regularity of their attendance.</p>

<h3>January 25th, 1832</h3>

<p>We met at Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s last night&mdash;Wharncliffe,
Harrowby, Haddington, and Sandon&mdash;and I
found their minds were quite made up. Wharncliffe is to
present a petition from Hull, and to take that opportunity
of making his declaration, and the other two are to support
him. Wharncliffe saw the Bishop of London in the morning,
who is decided the same way, and he asked Lord Devon,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
who knows the House of Lords very well, if he thought, in
the event of their raising the standard of moderate Reform,
that they would have adherents, to which he replied he was
convinced they would. Lord Harrowby saw the Archbishop,
who would not pledge himself, but appeared well disposed;
and altogether they think they can count upon nine bishops.
Wharncliffe spoke to the Duke of Wellington about Lord
Aberdeen&rsquo;s motion, and represented all the impolicy of it at
this moment, and the connection it might have with the Peerage
question; to which he only replied by enlarging on &lsquo;the
importance of the Belgic question,&rsquo; either unable or unwilling
to embrace this measure in its complex relations, and never
perceiving that the country cares not a straw about Belgium
or anything but Reform, though they may begin to care
about such things when this question is settled. Haddington
also went to Aberdeen, who would hear nothing; but he
and the Duke severally promised to speak to one another.
The question last night was whether Wharncliffe should say
his say directly, or wait (as he wishes to do) for a few days.
The decision of this he referred to me, and I have referred
it to Melbourne, to whom I have communicated what has
passed.</p>

<p>News came yesterday that the cholera had got within
three miles of Edinburgh, and to show the fallacy of any
theory about it, and the inutility of the prescribed precautions,
at one place (Newport, I think) one person in five of
the whole population was attacked, though there was no
lack of diet, warmth, and clothing for the poor. This
disease escapes from all speculation, so partial and eccentric
is its character.</p>

<h3>January 29th, 1832</h3>

<p>There were two divisions on Thursday
night last&mdash;in the House of Lords on the Belgian question,
and in the House of Commons on the Russian Loan. Harrowby,
Wharncliffe, and Haddington stayed away; Lyndhurst
voted. Only two bishops, Durham and Killaloe.
Ministers had a majority of thirty-seven, for Aberdeen and
the Duke persisted in bringing on the question and dividing
upon it. The former spoke nearly three hours, and far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISCREDIT OF MINISTERS.</span>
better than ever he had done before; the Duke was prosy.
In the other House the Government had not a shadow of a
case; their law officers, Home and Denman, displayed an
ignorance and stupidity which were quite ludicrous, and
nothing saved them from defeat but a good speech at the
end from Palmerston, and their remonstrances to their friends
that unless they carried it they must resign. Not a soul
defends them, and they are particularly blamed for their
folly in not coming to Parliament at once, by which they
might have avoided the
scrape.<a name="FNA_17_01" id="FNA_17_01"></a><a href="#FN_17_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
They had only a majority
of twenty-four. They were equally disgusted with both
these divisions, both plainly showing that they have little
power (independently of the Reform question) in either
House. To be sure the case in the House of Commons was
a wretched one, but in the House of Lords there was nothing
to justify a vote of censure on Government, to which Aberdeen&rsquo;s
motion was tantamount. But while they had a
majority which was respectable enough to make it impossible
to propose making Peers on <i>that account</i>, it was so small
that they see clearly what they have to expect hereafter
from such a House of Lords, and accordingly their adherents
have thrown off the mask. Sefton called on me the day
after, and said it was ridiculous to go on in this way, that
the Tories had had possession of the Government so many
years, and the power of making so many Peers, that no
Whig or other Ministry could stand without a fresh creation
to redress the balance.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_17_01" id="FN_17_01"></a><a href="#FNA_17_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[For a more particular account of the question of the Russo-Dutch
Loan, see <i>infra</i> [February 4, 1832], p. 244. It has since been universally admitted that the
conduct of the Government was wise and honourable, and that the separation
of Holland and Belgium did not exonerate Great Britain from a financial
engagement to foreign Powers.]</p></div>

<p>After having, as I supposed, settled everything with
Wharncliffe about his declaration, I got a letter from him
yesterday (from Brighton), saying he thought it would be
premature, and wished to put it off till the first reading
of the Bill in the House of Lords. I took his letter to
Melbourne, and told him I was all against the delay. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
said it was no doubt desirable they should get as many
adherents as they can, and if the delay would enable them
to do so it might be better, but they must not imagine
Government was satisfied with the division in the House of
Lords. However, the question of Peers seems not to be under
discussion at this moment, though it is perpetually revived.
In the evening I went to Harrowby&rsquo;s and showed him
Wharncliffe&rsquo;s letter. He concurred in the expediency of
delay, but without convincing me. He showed me a letter,
and a very good one, he has written to Lord Talbot, explaining
his views, and inviting his concurrence, and of this
he has sent copies to other Peers, whom he thinks it possible
he may influence. The question of time and manner is to
be reserved for future discussion.</p>

<h3>February 2nd, 1832</h3>

<p>Met Frederick Lamb at dinner to talk
over the state of affairs before he goes to Vienna. What he
wishes for is the expulsion of this Government, and the formation
of a moderate one taken from all parties. Received
another letter from Wharncliffe yesterday, in which he stated
that he had communicated to the Duke of Wellington his
intention of supporting the second reading, and asked if the
Duke would support his amendments in Committee. In the
meantime I wrote to Harrowby, begging he would communicate
with Lord Carnarvon and the Duke of Buckingham.
They keep doubting and fearing about who will or will not join
them, but do not stir a step. George Bentinck told me that
Lord Holland said to the Duke of Richmond the other day
&lsquo;that he had heard a declaration was in agitation; that
nothing could be more unfortunate at this moment, as it
would make it very difficult to create fifty Peers.&rsquo; In the
meantime a difficulty is likely to arise from another source,
and the Government to derive strength from their very weakness.
Robert Clive (who is a moderate Tory) called on me
the other day, and when (after expressing his anxiety that
the question should be settled) I asked him whether such a
declaration would meet with much success, said he thought
that it would have done so a fortnight ago, but that the extreme
discredit into which Ministers were fallen would now
operate as a reason against supporting them in any stage of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SIR HENRY PARNELL.</span>
the business, and offered so good a chance of expelling them
altogether that people would be anxious to try it. Still it
must be so obvious that it would be next to impossible to
make a Government now, that it is to be hoped all but the
most violent will feel it. Herries indeed told somebody that
he had no doubt the Tories could make a Government, and
that on a dissolution they would get a Parliament that would
support them.
Parnell<a name="FNA_17_02" id="FNA_17_02"></a><a href="#FN_17_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
has been turned out for not voting on
the Russian Loan affair, and Hobhouse appointed in his place.
Tennyson resigned from ill health. Parnell was properly
enough turned out, and he is a good riddance, but it is not
the same thing as turning people out on Reform. He wrote an
excellent book on finance, but he was a very bad Secretary
at War, a rash economical innovator, and a bad man of business
in its details. After waiting till the last moment for
the arrival of the Russian ratification, the French and
English signed the Belgian treaty alone, and the others are
to sign after as their powers arrive.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_17_02" id="FN_17_02"></a><a href="#FNA_17_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[Sir Henry Parnell had been appointed Secretary at War on the formation
of Lord Grey&rsquo;s Ministry. He had exasperated his colleagues by
entering upon an unauthorised negotiation with the French Post Office, without
the knowledge of the Duke of Richmond, then Postmaster-General,
and by encouraging Joseph Hume to bring on a motion against the Post
Office. Hume brought this letter to the Duke of Richmond, who was indignant
and laid the whole matter before Lord Grey, who behaved very well
about it. Parnell narrowly escaped dismissal at that time, and on his next
sign of disaffection to the Government he was turned out of office.]</p></div>

<h3>February 4th, 1832</h3>

<p>Called on Lord Harrowby in the morning;
found him in very bad spirits, as well he might, for to all
the invitations he had written to Peers he had received
either refusals or no reply, so that he augurs ill of their
attempt. Carnarvon and Talbot refused; these besotted,
predestinated Tories <i>will</i> follow the Duke; the Duke <i>will</i>
oppose all Reform because he said he would. Those who are
inclined will not avow their conversion to moderate principles,
and so they will go on, waiting and staring at one another,
till one fine day the Peers will come out in the &lsquo;Gazette.&rsquo;
The thing looks ill. Dined with Lord Holland. Melbourne,
who was there, asked me if I had heard from Wharncliffe,
but I did not tell him of Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s refusals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Falck dined there, and in conversation about the Russian
Loan he told us the original history of it. The Emperor of
Russia had borrowed ninety millions of florins, and when his
concurrence and support were desired to the new kingdom of
the Netherlands he proposed in return that the King of Holland
should take this debt off his hands. The King said he
would gladly meet his wishes, but could not begin by making
himself unpopular with his new subjects and saddling them
with this debt. Whereupon England interposed, and an arrangement
was made [in 1815] by which Russia, England,
and the King of the Netherlands divided the debt into three
equal shares, each taking one. With reference to the argument
that the countries being divided we ought no longer to
pay our share, Falck said the King of the Netherlands had not
refused to pay on those grounds, that he had only (with reference
to his heavy expenses) expressed his present inability
and asked for time, which the Emperor of Russia had agreed
to. What he meant was that the kingdoms were not as yet
<i>de jure</i> separated, and that the <i>casus</i> had not yet arrived.
This, however, is nothing to the purpose, for the King and the
Emperor understand one another very well, and it is not likely
that the King should do anything to supply us with a motive
or a pretext for refusing our <i>quota</i> to his imperial ally.
Brougham&rsquo;s speech on the Russian Loan everybody agrees to
have been super-excellent&mdash;&lsquo;a continued syllogism from the
beginning to the end.&rsquo; Lord Holland said, and the Duke of
Wellington (I am told) declared, it was the best speech he
had ever heard.</p>

<h3>February 5th, 1832</h3>

<p>Met Melbourne yesterday evening, and
turned back and walked with him; talked over the state of
affairs. He said Government were very much annoyed at
their division in the House of Commons, though Brougham
had in some measure repaired that disaster in the House of
Lords; that it became more difficult to resist making Peers
as Government exhibited greater weakness. I told him the
Tories were so unmanageable because they wished to drive
out the Government, and thought they could. Dined at the

<span class="pagehead">MACAULAY AT HOLLAND HOUSE.</span>
to Lady Harrowby; Lord Harrowby gone to his brothers&rsquo;.
Melbourne had told me that he had spoken to Haddington,
and I found Haddington had given a report of what he said
such as I am sure Melbourne did not mean to convey; the
upshot of which was that there was only one man in the
Cabinet who wished to make Peers, that there was no immediate
danger, and that it would do more harm than
good if they declared themselves without a good number of
adherents. Called this morning on Lady C., who said that
Melbourne was in fact very much annoyed at his position,
wanted <i>caractère</i>, was wretched at having been led so far,
and tossed backwards and forwards between opposite sentiments
and feelings; that he thought the Government very
weak, and that they would not stand, and in fact that he did
not desire they should remain in, but the contrary. And
this is Frederick&rsquo;s opinion too, who has great influence over
him, while at the same time he is rather jealous of Frederick.</p>

<h3>February 6th, 1832</h3>

<p>Dined yesterday with Lord Holland; came
very late, and found a vacant place between Sir George
Robinson and a common-looking man in black. As soon as
I had time to look at my neighbour, I began to speculate (as
one usually does) as to who he might be, and as he did not
for some time open his lips except to eat, I settled that he
was some obscure man of letters or of medicine, perhaps a
cholera doctor. In a short time the conversation turned
upon early and late education, and Lord Holland said he
had always remarked that self-educated men were peculiarly
conceited and arrogant, and apt to look down upon the
generality of mankind, from their being ignorant of how much
other people knew; not having been at public schools, they are
uninformed of the course of general education. My neighbour
observed that he thought the most remarkable example of
self-education was that of Alfieri, who had reached the age
of thirty without having acquired any accomplishment save
that of driving, and who was so ignorant of his own language
that he had to learn it like a child, beginning with elementary
books. Lord Holland quoted Julius Cæsar and Scaliger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
as examples of late education, said that the latter had been
wounded, and that he had been married and commenced
learning Greek the same day, when my neighbour remarked
&lsquo;that he supposed his learning Greek was not an instantaneous
act like his marriage.&rsquo; This remark, and the manner of it,
gave me the notion that he was a dull fellow, for it came
out in a way which bordered on the ridiculous, so as to excite
something like a sneer. I was a little surprised to hear him
continue the thread of conversation (from Scaliger&rsquo;s wound)
and talk of Loyola having been wounded at Pampeluna. I
wondered how he happened to know anything about Loyola&rsquo;s
wound. Having thus settled my opinion, I went on eating
my dinner, when Auckland, who was sitting opposite to me,
addressed my neighbour, &lsquo;Mr. Macaulay, will you drink a
glass of wine?&rsquo; I thought I should have dropped off my chair.
It was <span class="smcap">Macaulay</span>, the man I had been so long most curious
to see and to hear, whose genius, eloquence, astonishing knowledge,
and diversified talents have excited my wonder and
admiration for such a length of time, and here I had been
sitting next to him, hearing him talk, and setting him down
for a dull fellow. I felt as if he could have read my thoughts,
and the perspiration burst from every pore of my face, and
yet it was impossible not to be amused at the idea. It was
not till Macaulay stood up that I was aware of all the
vulgarity and ungainliness of his appearance; not a ray of
intellect beams from his countenance; a lump of more ordinary
clay never enclosed a powerful mind and lively imagination.
He had a cold and sore throat, the latter of which
occasioned a constant contraction of the muscles of the
thorax, making him appear as if in momentary danger of a
fit. His manner struck me as not pleasing, but it was not
assuming, unembarrassed, yet not easy, unpolished, yet not
coarse; there was no kind of usurpation of the conversation,
no tenacity as to opinion or facts, no assumption of superiority,
but the variety and extent of his information were soon
apparent, for whatever subject was touched upon he evinced
the utmost familiarity with it; quotation, illustration, anecdote,
seemed ready in his hands for every topic. Primogeniture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RELUCTANCE TO MAKE PEERS.</span>
in this country, in others, and particularly in ancient
Rome, was the principal topic, I think, but Macaulay was
not certain what was the law of Rome, except that when a
man died intestate his estate was divided between his children.
After dinner Talleyrand, and Madame de Dino came
in. He was introduced to Talleyrand, who told him that he
meant to go to the House of Commons on Tuesday, and that
he hoped he would speak, &lsquo;qu&rsquo;il avait entendu tous les
grands orateurs, et il désirait à présent entendre Monsieur
Macaulay.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>February 7th, 1832</h3>

<p>Called on Melbourne. He said he had
not meant Haddington to understand that it was desirable
the declaration should be delayed; on the contrary, that it
was desirable Ministers should be informed as speedily as possible
of the intentions of our friends and of the force they
can command, but that if only a few declared themselves,
they would certainly be liable to the suspicion that they
could not get adherents; he added that every man in the
Government (except one) was aware of the desperate nature
of the step they were about to take (that man of course
being Durham.) I told him that his communication to
Haddington had to a certain degree had the effect of
paralysing my exertions, and he owned it was imprudent.
I was, however, extremely surprised to hear what he said
about the Cabinet, and I asked him if it really was so, and
that all the members of it were <i>bonâ fide</i> alarmed at, and
averse to, the measure; that I had always believed that, with
the exception of those who were intimate with him, they all
wanted the pretext in order to establish their power. He
said no, they really all were conscious of the violence of the
measure, and desirous of avoiding it; that Lord Grey had
been so from the beginning, but that Durham was always at
him, and made him fall into his violent designs; that it was
&lsquo;a reign of terror,&rsquo; but that Durham could do with him what
he pleased. What a picture of secret degradation and imbecility
in the towering and apparently haughty Lord Grey! I
told Melbourne that it was important to gain time, that there
was an appearance of a thaw among the 199, but that most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of them were in the country; communications by letter
were difficult and unsatisfactory; that many were averse to
breaking up the party or leaving the Duke&mdash;in short, from
one cause or another doubtful and wavering; that it was not
to be expected they should at a moment&rsquo;s warning take this
new line, in opposition to the opinions and conduct of their
old leaders, and that when Lord Harrowby was exerting
himself indefatigably to bring them to reason, and to render
a measure unnecessary which in the opinion of the Cabinet
itself was fraught with evil, it was fair and just to give him
time to operate. He said this was very true, but that time
was likewise required to execute the measure of a creation of
Peers, that people must be invited, the patents made out, &amp;c.
We then parted. Downstairs was Rothschild the Jew
waiting for him, and the <i>valet de chambre</i> sweeping away a
<i>bonnet</i> and a <i>shawl</i>.</p>

<p>On my way from Melbourne called on Lord Harrowby,
and read a variety of letters&mdash;answers from different Peers to
his letters, Wharncliffe&rsquo;s correspondence with the Duke of
Wellington, and Peel&rsquo;s answer to Lord Harrowby. Wharncliffe
wrote a long and very conciliatory letter to the Duke,
nearly to the effect of Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s circular, and containing
the same arguments, to which the Duke replied by a long
letter, written evidently in a very ill humour, and such a
galimatias as I never read, angry, ill expressed, and confused,
and from which it was difficult to extract anything intelligible
but this, &lsquo;that he was aware of the consequences of the
course he should adopt himself,&rsquo; and wished the House of
Lords to adopt, viz., the same as last year, but that be those
consequences what they might, the responsibility would not
lie on his shoulders, but on those of the Government; he
acknowledged that a creation of Peers would swamp the
House of Lords, and, by so doing, destroy the Constitution,
but the Government would be responsible, not he, for the ruin
that would ensue; that he was aware some Reform was
necessary (in so far departing from his former declaration of
the 30th of November), but he would neither propose anything
himself, nor take this measure, nor try and amend it.&rsquo; In
short, he will do nothing but talk nonsense, despair, and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PEEL&rsquo;S DESPONDENCY.</span>
obstinate, and then he is hampered by declarations (from
which he now sees himself that he must dissent), and obliged
from causes connected with the Catholic question and the Test
and Corporation Acts to attend more to the consistency of
his own character than to the exigencies of the country, but
with much more personal authority than anybody, and still
blindly obeyed and followed by men many of whom take
very rational and dispassionate views of the subject, but who
still are resolved to sacrifice their own sense to his folly. He
really has accomplished being a prophet in his own country,
not from the sagacity of his predictions, but from the blind
worship of his devotees.</p>

<p>Peel&rsquo;s letter, though arriving at the same conclusion, was
in a very different style. It certainly was an able production,
well expressed and plausibly argued, with temper and
moderation. He owned that much was to be said on the
side of the question which he does not espouse, but the
reasons by which he says he is mainly governed are these:
that it is of vital importance to preserve the consistency of
the party to which we are to look for future safety, and that
when this excitement has passed away the conduct of the
anti-Reformers will have justice done to it. But there is a
contradiction which pervades his argument, for he treats the
subject as if all hope had vanished of saving the country,
&lsquo;desperat de republicâ,&rsquo; and he does not promise himself present
advantage from the firmness and consistency of the
Tories, but taking it in connection with the folly and wickedness
of the other party (who he is persuaded bitterly regret
their own precipitate violence and folly), he expects it to
prove serviceable as an example and beacon to future generations.
All the evils that have been predicted may flow
from this measure when carried into complete operation, but
it is neither statesmanlike nor manly to throw up the game
in despair, and surrender every point, and waive every compensation,
in order to preserve the consistency of himself and
his own party, not that their consistency is to produce any
advantage, but that hereafter it</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0em;">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
So senseless is this, that it is clear to me that it is not his
real feeling, and that he promises himself some personal advantage
from the adoption of such a course. Peel &lsquo;loves&rsquo;
himself, &lsquo;not wisely but too well.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>February 9th, 1832</h3>

<p>Yesterday I met Lord Grey and rode with
him. I told him that the Tories were pleased at his speech
about the Irish Tithes. He said &lsquo;he did not know why, for
he had not said what he did with a view to please them.&rsquo; I
said because they looked upon it as an intimation that the old
Protestant ascendency was to be restored. He rejected very
indignantly that idea, and said he had never contemplated
any ascendency but that of the law and the Government. I
said I knew that, but that they had been so long used to
consider themselves as the sole representatives of the law
and the Government, that they took the assertion he had
made as a notification that their authority was again to be
exercised as in bygone times. He then asked me if I knew
what Lord Harrowby had done, said he had spoken to him,
that he was placed in a difficult position and did not know
what to do. I said that Harrowby was exerting himself, that
time was required to bring people round, that I had reason
to believe Harrowby had made a great impression, but that
most of the Peers of that party were out of town, and it was
impossible to expect them on the receipt of a letter of invitation
and advice to reply by return of post that they would
abandon their leaders and their party, and change their
whole opinions and course of action, that I expected the
Archbishop and Bishop of London would go with him,
and that they would carry the bench. He said the
Bishop of London he had already talked to, that the
Archbishop was such a poor, miserable creature that
there was no dependence to be placed on him, that he would
be frightened and vote any way his fear directed. Then he
asked, how many had they <i>sure</i>? I said, &lsquo;At this moment not
above eight Lords and eight bishops.&rsquo; He said that was not
enough. I said I knew that, but he must have patience, and
should remember that when the Duke of Wellington brought
the Catholic Bill into the House of Commons he had a majority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONVERSATION WITH LORD GREY.</span>
on paper against him in the House of Lords of twenty-five,
and he carried the Bill by a hundred. He said he should like
to talk to Harrowby again, which I pressed him to do, and
he said he would. I find Lord John Russell sent for Sandon,
and told him that he and the others were really anxious to
avoid making Peers, and entreated him to get something done
by his father and his associates as soon as possible, that
there was no time to be lost, that he should not deny that he
wished Peers to be made, not now, but after the Reform Bill
had passed. I called on Lord Harrowby in the afternoon,
and found him half dead with a headache and dreadfully
irritable. Letters had come (which he had not seen) from
Lord Bagot refusing, Lord Carteret ditto, and very impertinently,
and Lord Calthorpe adhering. I told him what had
passed between Lord Grey and me. He said their insolence
had been hitherto so great in refusing to listen to any terms
(at the meeting of the six), and in refusing every concession
in the House of Commons and not tolerating the slightest
alteration, that he despaired of doing anything with them,
that Lord Grey had told him he could not agree to make a
sham resistance in Committee, but that he on the other hand
would not agree to go into Committee, except on an express
understanding that they should not avail themselves of the
probable disunion of the Tories to carry all the details of
their Bill. The difficulties are immense, but if Grey and
Harrowby get together, it is possible something may be done,
provided they will approach each other in a <i>spirit</i> of compromise.
It is certainly easier now, and very different from
the House of Commons, where I have always thought they
<i>could</i> make no concession. In the House of Lords they may
without difficulty. I dread the obstinate of both parties.</p>

<h3>February 11th, 1832</h3>

<p>Wharncliffe came to town on Thursday
and called on me. At Brighton he had seen Sir Andrew
Barnard, and showed him the correspondence with the
Duke of Wellington, telling him at the same time he might
mention it to Taylor if he liked, and if Taylor had any
wish to see it he should. Accordingly Taylor sent him
word he should be glad to have an interview with him. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
met at Lord Wharncliffe&rsquo;s house and had a long conversation,
in the course of which Taylor gave him to understand that
it was quite true that the King had consented to everything
about the creation of Peers, but <i>multa gemens</i>, and that he
was much alarmed, and could not endure the thought of this
measure. The end was that a memorandum was drawn up
of the conversation, and of Wharncliffe&rsquo;s sentiments and
intentions, which were much the same as those he had put
forth at the time of the old negotiations. This was taken
away by Taylor and shown to the King, and copies of it
were forwarded to Grey, Brougham, and Melbourne. The
next day Wharncliffe dined with the King, and after dinner
his Majesty took him aside and said, &lsquo;I have seen your
paper, and I agree with every word you say; we are indeed
in a scrape, and we must get out of it as we can. I only
wish everybody was as reasonable and as moderate as you,
and then we might do so perhaps without difficulty.&rsquo; That
the King is alarmed is pretty clear, but it is more probable
that his alarm may influence his Ministers than himself, and
it looks very much as if it had done so. Sir H. Taylor likewise
told Wharncliffe that the Duke of Wellington had written
a letter which had been laid before the King, and had given
him great offence, and that it certainly was such a letter as
was unbecoming in any subject to write. This letter is
supposed to have been addressed to Strangford; it got into
Londonderry&rsquo;s hands, and he laid it before the King (upon
the occasion of his going with some address to Brighton),
who desired it might be left with him till the next day. The
reason why they think it was Strangford is that the word
&lsquo;Viscount&rsquo; was apparent at the bottom, but the name was
erased. In the meantime Harrowby has had some conversation
with Lord Lansdowne, who pressed the necessity of
making a demonstration of their strength, and added that
if the Archbishop could be induced to declare himself that
would be sufficient. Lord Harrowby is accordingly working
incessantly upon the Archbishop on the one hand, while he
exhorts to patience and reliance on the other. Yesterday
he took a high tone with Lord Lansdowne, told him that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WELLINGTON AND WHARNCLIFFE.</span>
he had, as he firmly believed, as many as twenty-five Lords,
lay and spiritual, with him, which would make a difference
of fifty, but that as to a public irrevocable pledge, it was not
to be had, and that Lord Grey must place confidence in his
belief and reliance upon his exertions, or, if not, he must
take his own course. Upon Lord Grey&rsquo;s meeting with him,
and the Archbishop&rsquo;s being brought to the post, the matter
now hinges.</p>

<p>In the meantime I have discovered the cause of the
Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s peevish reply to Wharncliffe, and
the reason why Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s letter to Lord Bagot was
unanswered for ten days, and then couched in terms so different
from what might have been expected. Lord Howe
was at Bliffield at the time, and they, between them, sent
Harrowby&rsquo;s letter up to the Duke of Wellington, who of
course wrote his sentiments in reply. For this they waited,
and on this Lord Bagot acted. My brother told me yesterday
that the Duke had seen the letter, and that <i>Lord Howe</i>
had been the person who sent it him. This explains it all.
Wharncliffe&rsquo;s letter was but another version of Lord
Harrowby&rsquo;s, and he had therefore in fact seen it before,
but seen it addressed to those whom he considered bound
to him and his views, and I have no doubt he was both
angry and jealous at Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s interference. Nothing
could be more uncandid and unjustifiable than Lord Bagot&rsquo;s
conduct, for he never asked Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s leave to communicate
the letter, nor told him that he had done so; on
the contrary, he gave him to understand that the delay (for
which he made many apologies) was owing to his reflection
and his consulting his brother the bishop. The Duke, no
doubt, gave him his own sentiments; yet, in his letter to
Wharncliffe, he says &lsquo;he has not endeavoured to influence
anybody, nor shall he;&rsquo; and at the same time eludes the
essential question &lsquo;whether he will support in Committee.&rsquo;
So much for Tory candour. As to the Duke, he is evidently
piqued and provoked to the quick; his love of power and
authority are as great as ever, and he can&rsquo;t endure to see
anybody withdrawn from his influence; provoked with himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and with everybody else, his mind is clouded by passion and
prejudice, and the consequences are the ill-humour he displays
and the abominable nonsense he writes, and yet the
great mass of these Tories follow the Duke, go where he will,
let the consequences be what they may, and without requiring
even a reason; <i>sic vult sic jubet</i> is enough for them. One
thing that gives me hopes is the change in the language of
the friends of Government out of doors&mdash;Dover, for instance,
who has been one of the noisiest of the bawlers for Peers.
I walked with him from the House of Lords the night before
last, and he talked only of the break-up of the 199, and of
the activity of Harrowby and Wharncliffe and its probable
effects.</p>

<h3>February 14th, 1832</h3>

<p>On Saturday evening I found Melbourne
at the Home Office in his lazy, listening, silent humour, disposed
to hear everything and to say very little; told me that
Dover and Sefton were continually <i>at</i> the Chancellor to make
Peers, and that they both, particularly the latter, had great
influence with him. Brougham led by Dover and Sefton!!
I tried to impress upon him the necessity of giving Harrowby
credit, and not exacting what was not to be had, viz., the
<i>pledges</i> of the anti-Reformers to vote for the second reading.
He owned that in their case he would not pledge himself
either. I put before him as strongly as I could all the various
arguments for resisting this desperate measure of making
Peers (to which he was well inclined to assent), and pressed
upon him the importance of not exasperating the Tories and
the Conservative party to the last degree, and placing such
an impassable barrier between public men on both sides as
should make it impossible for them to reunite for their common
interest and security hereafter.</p>

<p>In the evening I got a message from Palmerston to beg
I would call on him, which I did at the Foreign Office yesterday.
He is infinitely more alert than Melbourne, and
more satisfactory to talk to, because he enters with more
warmth and more detail into the subject. He began by
referring to the list of Peers likely to vote for the second
reading, which I showed to him. At the same time I told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONVERSATION WITH LORD PALMERSTON.</span>
him that though he might make use of the information
generally as far as expressing his own belief that Lord
Harrowby would have a sufficient following, he must not
produce the list or quote the names, for, in fact, not one of
them had given any authority to be so counted; that he must
be aware there were persons who would be glad to mar our
projects, and they could not more effectually do so than by
conveying to these Peers the use that had been made of their
names. To all this he agreed entirely. He then talked of
the expediency of a declaration from Lord Harrowby, and
how desirable it was that it should be made soon, and be supported
by as many as could be induced to come forward; that
Lord Grey had said to him very lately that he really believed
he should be obliged to create Peers. I said that my persuasion
was that it would be quite unnecessary to do so <i>to
carry the second reading</i>; that nothing was required but
confidence in Lord Harrowby, and that his character and
his conduct on this occasion entitled him to expect it from
them; that if they were sincere in their desire to avoid this
measure they would trust to his exertions; that I knew very
well the efforts that were made to force this measure on
Lord Grey; that it was in furtherance of this that
Duncombe&rsquo;s<a name="FNA_17_03" id="FNA_17_03"></a><a href="#FN_17_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
ridiculous affair in the House of Commons had
been got up, which had been such a complete failure; but
that I could not believe Lord Grey would suffer himself to
be bullied into it by such despicable means, and by the
clamour of such men as Duncombe and O&rsquo;Connell, urged on
by friends of his own. He said this was very true, but the
fact was they could not risk the rejection of the Bill again;
that he knew from a variety of communications that an explosion
would inevitably follow its being thrown out on the
second reading; that he had had letters from Scotland and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
other places, and had no doubt that such would be the case. I
said that he would find it very difficult to persuade our friends
of this, and it appeared to me as clear as possible that the
feeling for the Bill and the excitement had subsided; that
they might be to a certain degree renewed by its rejection,
but no man could doubt that modifications in it, which would
have been impossible a few months ago, would now be
easy; that if it was not for that unfortunate declaration
of Lord Grey, by which he might consider himself bound, he
might safely consent to such changes as would make the
adjustment of the question no difficult matter; that with
regard to the rejection of the Bill, whatever excitement it
might produce, it was evident the Government had an
immediate remedy; they had only to prorogue Parliament
for a week and make their Peers, and they would <i>then</i> have
an excellent pretext&mdash;indeed, so good a one that it was inconceivable
to me that they should hesitate for a moment in
adopting that course. This he did not deny. I then told
him of the several conversations between Lord Harrowby
and Lords Grey and Lansdowne, and mine with Lord
Grey; that Lord Harrowby protested against Lord Grey&rsquo;s
availing himself of any disunion among the Opposition (produced
by his support of the second reading) to carry those
points, to resist which would be the sole object of Lord
Harrowby in seceding from his party; and that Lord Grey
had said he could not make a sham resistance. Palmerston
said, &lsquo;We have brought in a Bill which we have made as
good as we can; it is for you to propose any alterations you
wish to make in it, and if you can beat us, well and good.
There are indeed certain things which, if carried against us,
would be so fatal to the principle of the Bill that Lord
Grey would not consider it worth carrying if so amended;
but on other details he is ready to submit, if they should be
carried against him.&rsquo; I said that would not do, that I must
refer him to the early negotiations and the disposition which
was then expressed to act upon a principle of mutual concession;
that when Lord Harrowby and his friends were prepared
to concede to its fullest extent the principle of disfranchisement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONVERSATION WITH LORD PALMERSTON.</span>
(though they might propose alterations in a
few particulars), they had a right to expect that the Government
should surrender without fighting some of those
equivalents or compensations which they should look for in
the alterations or additions they might propose. He said
that &lsquo;while Lord Harrowby was afraid that Ministers might
avail themselves of his weakness to carry their details, <i>they</i>
were afraid lest Lord Harrowby and his friends should unite
with the ultra-Tories to beat them in Committee on some of
the essential clauses of the Bill.&rsquo; I replied, then it was fear
for fear, and under the circumstances the best thing was an
understanding that each party should act towards the other
in a spirit of good faith, and without taking any accidental
advantage that might accrue either way. We then discussed
the possibility of an agreement upon the details, and he
enquired what they would require. I told him that they
would require an alteration of Schedule B to exclude the
town voters from county representation, perhaps to vary the
franchise, and some other things, with regard to which I
could not speak positively at the moment. He said he thought
some alteration might be made in Schedule B, particularly
in giving all the towns double members, by cutting off the
lower ones that had one; that it was intended no man should
have a vote for town and county on the <i>same</i> qualification,
and he believed there were very few who would possess the
double right. That I said would make it more easy to give
up, and it was a thing the others laid great stress upon. He
seemed to think it might be done. As to the 10&#8467;., he said he
had at first been disposed to consider it too low, but he had
changed his mind, and now doubted if it would not turn out to
be too high. We then talked of the metropolitan members,
to which I said undoubtedly they wished to strike them off,
but they knew very well the Government desired it equally.
We agreed that I should get from Lord Harrowby specifically
what he would require, and he would give me in return what
concessions the Government would probably be disposed to
make; that these should be communicated merely as the
private opinions of individuals, and not as formal proposals;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and we should try and blend them together into some feasible
compromise.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_17_03" id="FN_17_03"></a><a href="#FNA_17_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
Duncombe brought forward a petition from six men at Barnet complaining
that they had been entrapped into signing Lord Verulam&rsquo;s and Lord
Salisbury&rsquo;s address to the King. The object was to produce a discussion
about the Peers. It totally failed, but it was got up with an openness that
was indecent by Durham and that crew, who were all (Durham, Sefton, Mulgrave,
Dover) under the gallery to hear it. The thing was ridiculed by Peel,
fell flat upon the House, and excited disgust and contempt out of it.</p></div>

<p>I afterwards saw the Duke of Richmond, who said that
Dover and Sefton had both attacked him for being against
making Peers, and he should like to know how they knew
it. I told him, from the Chancellor, to be sure, and added
how they were always working at him and the influence
they had with him. He said the Chancellor&rsquo;s being for
making Peers was not enough to carry the question; that if
it was done it must be by a minute of the Cabinet, with the
names of the dissentients appended to it; and then the King
must determine; that if the dissentients seceded upon it it
would be impossible. He recollected, when there was a
question of making Peers on the Catholic question by the
Duke of Wellington, that he and some others had resolved,
should it have been done, to avail themselves of the power of
the House to come down day after day and move adjournments
before any of the new Peers could take their seats;
that the same course might be adopted now, though it would
produce a revolution. I told him that I had little doubt
there were men who would not scruple to adopt any course,
however violent, that the power of Parliament would admit
of; that there were several who were of opinion that the
creation of Peers would at once lay the Constitution prostrate
and bring about a revolution; that they considered it would
be not a remote and uncertain, but a sure and proximate
event, and if by accelerating it they could crush their opponents
they would do so without hesitation.</p>

<p>In the meantime the cholera has made its appearance in
London, at Rotherhithe, Limehouse, and in a ship off Greenwich&mdash;in
all seven cases. These are amongst the lowest and
most wretched classes, chiefly Irish, and a more lamentable
exhibition of human misery than that given by the medical
men who called at the Council Office yesterday I never heard.
They are in the most abject state of poverty, without beds to
lie upon. The men live by casual labour, are employed by
the hour, and often get no more than four or five hours&rsquo;
employment in the course of the week. They are huddled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">INTERVIEW OF LORD HARROWBY AND LORD GREY.</span>
and crowded together by families in the same room, not as
permanent lodgers, but procuring a temporary shelter; in
short, in the most abject state of physical privation and
moral degradation that can be imagined. On Saturday we
had an account of one or more cases. We sent instantly
down to inspect the district and organise a Board of Health.
A meeting was convened, and promises given that all things
needful should be done, but as they met at a public-house they
all got drunk and did nothing. We have sent down members
of the Board of Health, to make preparations and organise
boards; but, if the disease really spreads, no human power
can arrest its progress through such an Augean stable.</p>

<h3>February 14th, 1832</h3>

<p>Dined with Lord Harrowby, and communicated
conversation with Palmerston and Melbourne.
He has not been able to decide the Archbishop, who is on and
off, and can&rsquo;t make up his mind. Lord Harrowby is going
to Lord Grey to talk with him. The Tories obstinate as
mules. The Duke of Buccleuch, who had got Harrowby&rsquo;s
letter, and copied it himself that he might know it by heart,
has made up his mind to vote the other way, as he did before;
Lord Wallace (after a long correspondence) the same. There
can be little doubt that they animate one another, and their
cry is &lsquo;to stick to the Duke of Wellington.&rsquo; The cholera is
established, and yesterday formal communications were made
to the Lord Mayor and to the Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs that London was no longer healthy.</p>

<h3>February 17th, 1832</h3>

<p>Wharncliffe came to town the night
before last, it having been settled that Harrowby was to go to
Lord Grey yesterday morning. After consultation we agreed
he had better go alone, that it would be less formal, and that
Lord Grey would be more disposed to open himself. The same
evening, at Madame de Lieven&rsquo;s ball, Melbourne and Palmerston
both told me that Grey was in an excellent disposition.
However, yesterday morning Harrowby had such a
headache that he was not fit to go alone, so the two went.
Nothing could be more polite than Grey, and on the whole
the interview was satisfactory. Nothing was agreed upon,
all left <i>dans le vague</i>; but a disposition to mutual confidence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
was evinced, and I should think it pretty safe that no Peers
will be made. Lord Grey told them that if they could
relieve him from the necessity of creating Peers he should
be sincerely obliged to them, showed them a letter from the
King containing the most unlimited power for the purpose,
and said that, armed with that authority, if the Bill could be
passed in no other way, it must be so. A minute was drawn
up to this effect, of which Wharncliffe showed me a copy
last night.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lords Harrowby and Wharncliffe cannot give any
names, or pledge themselves to any particular persons or
numbers who will support their views, but they have no
doubt in their own minds that there will be, <i>in the event of
no creation of Peers</i>, a sufficient number to carry the second
reading of the Bill. In voting themselves for the second
reading, their intention is to propose such alterations in Committee
as, in their opinion, can alone render it a measure
fit to be passed into law, and in the event of their being
unable to effect the changes they deem indispensable, they
reserve to themselves the power of opposing the Bill in its
subsequent stages. Lord Grey considers the great principles
of the Bill of such vital importance that he could not agree
to any alteration in them, but admits that a modification of
its details need not be fatal to it, reserving to himself, if any
of its vital principles should be touched, the power of taking
such ulterior measures as he may find necessary to ensure
its success. Lords Harrowby and Wharncliffe are prepared
to make a declaration of their sentiments and intentions in
the House of Lords at a proper time, that time to be a subject
of consideration; and in the event of their having reason to
believe that their present expectations are not likely to be
fulfilled, they will feel bound to give Lord Grey information
thereof, in order that he may take such measures as he may
think right.&rsquo;<a name="FNA_17_04" id="FNA_17_04"></a><a href="#FN_17_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_17_04" id="FN_17_04"></a><a href="#FNA_17_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
This is the substance, not a textual copy.</p></div>

<p>At present the principal difficulty promises to be the 10&#8467;.
clause. Lord Grey seemed to think this could not be altered.
Wharncliffe asked if it might not be modified, and so settled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DISTRESS IN BETHNAL GREEN.</span>
as to secure its being a <i>bonâ fide</i> 10&#8467;. clause, from which Lord
Grey did not dissent, but answered rather vaguely.</p>

<p>In the meantime I think some progress is made in the
work of conversion. Harris has gone back, and Wilton,
whom I always doubted. I doubt anybody within the immediate
sphere of the Duke, but Wynford is well disposed,
and the Archbishop has nearly given in. His surrender would
clinch the matter. I am inclined to think we shall get through
the second reading. Lord Grey was attacked by Madame de
Lieven the other day, who told him he was naturally all
that is right-minded and good, but was supposed to be influenced
against his own better judgment by those about him.
She also said something to the Duke of Wellington about
Lord Harrowby, to which he replied that Lord Harrowby
&lsquo;était une mauvaise tête!&rsquo; Very amusing from him, but he
is provoked to death that anybody should venture to desert
from him.</p>

<p>The cholera has produced more alertness than alarm here;
in fact, at present it is a mere trifle&mdash;in three days twenty-eight
persons. Nothing like the disorders which rage
unheeded every year and every day among the lower orders.
It is its name, its suddenness, and its frightful symptoms
that terrify. The investigations, however, into the condition
of the different parishes have brought to light dreadful cases
of poverty and misery. A man came yesterday from Bethnal
Green with an account of that district. They are all
weavers, forming a sort of separate community; there they
are born, there they live and labour, and there they die.
They neither migrate nor change their occupation; they
can do nothing else. They have increased in a ratio at
variance with any principles of population, having nearly
tripled in twenty years, from 22,000 to 62,000. They are
for the most part out of employment, and can get none; 1,100
are crammed into the poor-house, five or six in a bed;
6,000 receive parochial relief. The parish is in debt; every
day adds to the number of paupers and diminishes that of
ratepayers. These are principally small shopkeepers, who
are beggared by the rates. The district is in a complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
state of insolvency and hopeless poverty, yet they multiply,
and while the people look squalid and dejected, as if borne
down by their wretchedness and destitution, the children
thrive and are healthy. Government is ready to interpose
with assistance, but what can Government do? We asked
the man who came what could be done for them. He said
&lsquo;employment,&rsquo; and employment is impossible.</p>

<h3>February 20th, 1832</h3>

<p>Lord Grey was very much pleased with
the result of his interview, and expresses unbounded reliance
on Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s honour. The ultras, of course,
will give him no credit, and don&rsquo;t believe he can command
votes enough; &lsquo;l&rsquo;affaire marche, mais lentement,&rsquo; and the
seceders (or those we hope will be so) will not declare themselves
positively. There is no prevailing upon them. The
Archbishop is with us one day, and then doubts, though I
think we shall have him at last. A good deal of conversation
passed between Grey and Harrowby, which the latter
considers confidential and won&rsquo;t repeat. It was about the
details; the substance of the minute he feels at liberty to
communicate. By way of an episode, news came last night
of an insurrection of the slaves in Jamaica, in which fifty-two
plantations had been destroyed. It was speedily suppressed
by Willoughby Cotton, and the ringleaders were
executed by martial law.</p>

<h3>February 23rd, 1832</h3>

<p>At Court yesterday; long conversation
with Melbourne, and in the evening with Charles Wood and
Richmond, who is more alarmed about the Peers. Melbourne
had got an idea that Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s letter, which
had been reported if not shown to the Government, had
done a great deal of harm, inasmuch as it set forth so
strongly the same arguments to the Tories to show them
the danger of letting Peers be made that Durham and Co.
make use of as an argument for the same. I promised to
show it him, and replied that they could not expect Lord
Harrowby to do anything but employ the arguments that
are most likely to take effect with these people, but they are
not put in an offensive manner. Melbourne said that the
King is more reconciled to the measure, i.e. that they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD HARROWBY&rsquo;S LETTER.</span>
got the foolish, old man in town and can talk him over more
readily. A discussion last night about the propriety of
making a declaration to-day in the House of Lords, when
the Duke of Rutland presents a petition against Reform.
The Archbishop will not decide; there is no moving him.
Curious that a Dr. Howley, the other day Canon of Christ
Church, a very ordinary man, should have in his hands the
virtual decision of one of the most momentous matters that
ever occupied public attention. There is no doubt that his
decision would decide the business so far. Up to this time
certainly Harrowby and Wharncliffe have no certainty of a
sufficient number for the second reading; but I think they
will have enough at last.</p>

<h3>February 24th, 1832</h3>

<p>Harrowby and Wharncliffe agreed, if the
Duke of Rutland on presenting his petition gave them a
good opportunity, they would speak. It was a very good
one, for the petition turned out to be one for a moderate
Reform, more in their sense than in the Duke&rsquo;s own;
but the moment it was read Kenyon jumped up. Harrowby
thought he was going to speak upon it, whereas he presented
another; and I believe he was put up by the Duke
to stop any discussion.</p>

<p>In the evening went to Lord Holland&rsquo;s, when he and she
asked me about the letter. Somebody had given abstracts
of it, with the object of proving to Lord Grey that Harrowby
had been uncandid, or something like it, and had held out
to the Tories that if they would adopt his line they would
turn out the Government. Holland and the rest fancied the
letter had been written <i>since the interview</i>, but I told them it
was <i>three weeks before</i>, and I endeavoured to explain that the
abstracts must be taken in connection not only with the rest
of the text, but with the argument. Holland said Lord Grey
meant to ask Harrowby for the letter. From thence I went
to Harrowby, and told him this. He said he would not show
it, that Grey had no right to ask for a private letter written
by him weeks before to one of his friends, and it was beneath
him to answer for and explain anything he had thought fit
to say. But he has done what will probably answer as well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
for he has given Ebrington a copy of it for the express purpose
of going to Lord Grey and explaining anything that appears
ambiguous to him. As the business develops itself, and
the time approaches, communication becomes more open
and frequent; the Tories talk with great confidence of their
majority, and the ultra-Whigs are quite ready to believe
them; the two extreme ends are furious. Our list up to this
day presents a result of forty-three votes to thirty-seven
doubtful, out of which it is hard if a majority cannot be got.
I have no doubt now that they will take a very early opportunity
of making a declaration. Peel, in the other House,
is doing what he can to inflame and divide, and repress any
spirit of conciliation. Nothing is sure in his policy but that
it revolves round himself as the centre, and is influenced by
some view which he takes of his own future advantage, probably
the rallying of the Conservative party (as they call
themselves, though they are throwing away everything into
confusion and sinking everything by their obstinacy) and his
being at the head of it. He made a most furious and mischievous
speech.</p>

<h3>February 29th, 1832</h3>

<p>Ebrington took Harrowby&rsquo;s letter to
Lord Grey, who was satisfied but not pleased; the date and
the circumstances (which were explained) removed all bad
impressions from his mind. Since this a garbled version (or
rather extracts) has appeared in the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; which endeavours
to make a great stir about it. Harrowby was very
much annoyed, and thought of sending the letter itself to
the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; to be published at once; but Haddington and
I both urged him not, and last night he put a contradiction
in the &lsquo;Globe.&rsquo; I have little doubt that this as well as the
former extracts came from the shop of Durham and Co., and
so Melbourne told me he thought likewise. There was a great
breeze at the last Cabinet dinner between Durham and Richmond
again on the old subject&mdash;the Peers. I believe they will
now take their chance. Our list presents forty-seven sure
votes besides the doubtful, but not many pledges. As to me,
I am really puzzled what to wish for&mdash;that is, for the success
of which party, being equally disgusted with the folly of both.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">VIOLENCE OF EXTREME PARTIES.</span>
My old aversion for the High Tories returns when I see their
conduct on this occasion. The obstinacy of the Duke, the
selfishness of Peel, the pert vulgarity of Croker, and the incapacity
of the rest are set in constant juxtaposition with
the goodness of the cause they are now defending, but which
they will mar by their way of defending it. A man is
wanting, a fresh man, with vigour enough to govern, and
who will rally round him the temperate and the moderate of
different parties&mdash;men unfettered by prejudices, connections,
and above all by pledges, expressed or implied, and who can
and will address themselves to the present state and real
wants of the country, neither terrified into concession by the
bullying of the press and the rant of public meetings and
associations, nor fondly lingering over bygone systems of
government and law. That the scattered materials exist is
probable, but the heated passion of the times has produced
so much repulsion among these various atoms that it is
difficult to foresee when a cooler temperature may permit
their cohesion into any efficient mass.</p>

<h3>March 6th, 1842</h3>

<p>The ultra-Whigs and ultra-Tories are both
outrageous. Day after day the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; puts forth paragraphs,
evidently manufactured in the Durham shop, about
Harrowby&rsquo;s letter, and yesterday there was one which exhibited
their mortification and rage so clearly as to be quite
amusing, praising the Duke and the Tories, and abusing
Harrowby and Wharncliffe and the moderates. In the
meantime, while Lord Grey is negotiating with Harrowby for
the express purpose of avoiding the necessity of making Peers,
Durham, his colleague and son-in-law, in conjunction with
Dover, is (or has been) going about with a paper for signature
by Peers, being a requisition to Lord Grey to make new
Peers, inviting everybody he could find to sign this by way
of assisting that course of bullying and violence he has long
pursued, but happily in vain. Lord Grey is, I believe, really
disgusted with all these proceedings; he submits and does
nothing. Richmond quarrels with Durham, Melbourne
damns him, and the rest hate him. But there he is,
frowning, sulking, bullying, and meddling, and doing all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
harm he can. Never certainly was there such a Government
as this, so constituted, so headed&mdash;a chief with an imposing
exterior, a commanding eloquence, and a
character<a name="FNA_17_05" id="FNA_17_05"></a><a href="#FN_17_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
below
contempt, seduced and governed by anybody who will
minister to his vanity and presume upon his facility.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_17_05" id="FN_17_05"></a><a href="#FNA_17_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
By character I mean what the French call <i>caractère</i>, not that he is
wanting in honour and honesty, nor in ability, but in resolution and strength
of mind.</p></div>

<p>There has been nothing remarkable in either House of
Parliament but an attack made by Londonderry on Plunket,
who gave him so terrific a dressing that it required to be as
<i>pachydermatous</i> as he is to stand it. He is, however, a glutton,
for he took it all, and seemed to like it. I dined with
Madame de Lieven a day or two ago, and was talking to her
about politics and political events, and particularly about the
memoirs, or journal, or whatever it be, that she has written.
She said she had done so very irregularly, but that what she
regretted was not having kept more exact records of the
events and transactions of the Belgian question (which is
not yet settled), that it was in its circumstances the most
curious that could be, and exhibited more remarkable manifestations
of character and &lsquo;du c&oelig;ur humain,&rsquo; as well as of
politics generally, than any course of events she knew. I
asked her why she did not give them now. She said it was
impossible, that the &lsquo;nuances&rsquo; were so delicate and so numerous,
the details so nice and so varying, that unless caught
at the moment they escaped, and it was impossible to collect
them again.</p>

<h3>March 9th, 1832</h3>

<p>Went to Lord Holland&rsquo;s the other night, and
had a violent battle with him on politics. Nobody so violent
as he, and curious as exhibiting the opinions of the ultras of
the party. About making Peers&mdash;wanted to know what
Harrowby&rsquo;s real object was. I told him none but to prevent
what he thought an enormous evil. What did it signify (he
said) whether Peers were made now or later? that the present
House of Lords never could go on with a Reformed Parliament,
it being opposed to all the wants and wishes of the
people, hating the abolition of tithes, the press, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">IRISH NATIONAL EDUCATION.</span>
French Revolution, and that in order to make it harmonise
with the Reformed Parliament it must be amended by an
infusion of a more Liberal cast. This was the spirit of his
harangue, which might have been easily answered, for it all
goes upon the presumption that his party is that which harmonises
with the popular feeling, and what he means by
improving the character of the House is to add some fifty or
sixty men who may be willing to accept peerages upon the
condition of becoming a body-guard to this Government.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Times&rsquo; yesterday and the day before attacked Lord
Grey with a virulence and indecency about the Peers that is
too much even for those who take the same line, and he now
sees where his subserviency to the press has conducted him.
In the House of Commons the night before last, Ministers
would have been beaten on the sugar duties if Baring Wall,
who had got ten people to dinner, had chosen to go down in
time.</p>

<p>The principal subject of discussion this last week has
been the Education Board in Ireland, the object of which is
to combine the education of Catholics and Protestants by an
arrangement with regard to the religious part of their
instruction that may be compatible with the doctrines and
practice of both. This arrangement consists in there
being only certain selections from the Bible, which are
admitted generally, while particular days and hours are set
apart for the separate religious exercises of each class.
This will not do for the zealous Protestants, who bellow for
the whole Bible as Reformers do for the whole Bill.
While the whole system is crumbling to dust under their
feet, while the Church is prostrate, property of all kind
threatened, and robbery, murder, starvation, and agitation
rioting over the land, these wise legislators are debating
whether the brats at school shall read the whole Bible or
only parts of it. They do nothing but rave of the barbarism
and ignorance of the Catholics; they know that education
alone can better their moral condition, and that their religious
tenets prohibit the admission of any system of education (in
which Protestants and Catholics can be joined) except such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
an one as this, and yet they would rather knock the system
on the head, and prevent all the good that may flow from it,
than consent to a departure from the good old rules of Orange
ascendency and Popish subserviency and degradation, knowing
too, above all, that those who are to read and be taught
are equally indifferent to the whole Bible or to parts of it,
that they comprehend it not, have no clear and definite ideas
on the subject but as matter of debate, vehicle of dispute and
dissension, and almost of religious hatred and disunion, and
that when once they have escaped from the trammels of their
school, not one in a hundred will trouble his head about
the Bible at all, and not one in a thousand attend to its
moral precepts.</p>

<h3>March 10th, 1832</h3>

<p>Yesterday morning Wharncliffe came to me
to give me an account of the conversation the other day between
him and Harrowby on one side and Lords Grey and
Lansdowne on the other. Harrowby was headachy and out
of sorts. However, it went off very satisfactorily; the list
was laid before Grey, who was satisfied, and no Peers are to
be made before the second reading; but he said that if the
Bill should be carried by so small a majority as to prove that
the details could not be carried in Committee, he must reserve
the power of making Peers <i>then</i>. At this Harrowby
winced, but Wharncliffe said he thought it fair; and in fact
it is only in conformity with the protocol that was drawn up
at the last conversation. They entered into the details, and
Lord Grey said the stir that had been made about the metropolitan
members might raise difficulties, and then asked would
they agree to this, to give members to Marylebone and
throw over the rest? To this Harrowby would not agree,
greatly to Wharncliffe&rsquo;s annoyance, who would have agreed,
and I think he would have been in the right. It would have
been as well to have nailed Grey to this, and if Harrowby
had not had a headache I think he would have done so. With
regard to the 10&#8467;. clause, Wharncliffe <i>thinks</i> they will not
object to a modification. Grey spoke of the press, and with
just wrath and indignation of the attacks on himself. On
the whole this was good. The capture of Vandamme was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">IRISH TITHES.</span>
the consequence of a bellyache, and the metropolitan representation
depended on a headache. If the truth could be
ascertained, perhaps many of the greatest events in history
turned upon aches of one sort or another. Montaigne might
have written an essay on it.</p>

<h3>March 12th, 1832</h3>

<p>Durham made another exhibition of temper
at the Cabinet dinner last Wednesday. While Lord Grey
was saying something he rudely interrupted him, as his custom
is. Lord Grey said, &lsquo;But, my dear Lambton, only hear
what I was going to say,&rsquo; when the other jumped up and
said, &lsquo;Oh, if I am not to be allowed to speak I may as well
go away,&rsquo; rang the bell, ordered his carriage, and marched
off. Wharncliffe came to me yesterday morning to propose
writing a pamphlet in answer to the &lsquo;Quarterly Review,&rsquo; which
has got an article against his party. I suggested instead
that an attempt should be made by Sandon (who has been
in some communication with the editor about this matter)
to induce the &lsquo;Morning Herald&rsquo; to support us, and make
that paper the vehicle of our articles. This he agreed to,
and was to propose it to Sandon last night. We have no
advocate in the press; the Whig and Tory papers are equally
violent against us. Yesterday I saw a letter which has
been circulated among the Tories, written by young Lord
Redesdale to Lord Bathurst, a sort of counter-argument to
Lord Harrowby&rsquo;s letter, although not an answer, as it was
written before he had seen that document; there is very
little in it.</p>

<h3>March 16th, 1832</h3>

<p>Lord Grey made an excellent speech in the
House of Lords in reply to Aberdeen&rsquo;s questions about
Ancona, and Peel made another in the House of Commons
on Irish Tithes, smashing Sheil, taking high ground and
a strong position, but doing nothing towards settling the
question. He forgets that the system is bad, resting on
a false foundation, and that it has worked ill and been
bolstered up by him and his party till now it can no longer
be supported, and it threatens to carry away with it that
which is good in itself. We owe these things to those who
wilfully introduced a moral confusion of ideas into their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
political machinery, and, by destroying the essential distinction
between right and wrong, have deprived the things
which are right of the best part of their security. I have
never been able to understand why our system should be
made to rest on artificial props when it did not require them,
nor the meaning of that strange paradox which a certain
school of statesmen have always inculcated, that institutions
of admitted excellence required to be conjoined with others
which were founded in crime and error, and which could only
be supported by power. This has brought about Reform; it
would be easy to prove it. The Ancona affair will blow over.
George Villiers writes me word that it was a little escapade
of Périer&rsquo;s, done in a hurry, a mistake, and yet he is a very
able man. Talleyrand told me &lsquo;c&rsquo;est une bêtise.&rsquo; Nothing
goes on well; the world is out of joint.</p>

<p>Fanny Kemble&rsquo;s new tragedy came out last night with
complete success, written when she was seventeen, an odd
play for a girl to write. The heroine is tempted like
Isabella in &lsquo;Measure for Measure,&rsquo; but with a different result,
which result is supposed to take place between the acts.</p>

<h3>March 26th, 1832</h3>

<p>Ten days since I have written anything here,
but <i>en revanche</i> I have written a pamphlet. An article appeared
in the &lsquo;Quarterly,&rsquo; attacking Harrowby and his friends.
Wharncliffe was so desirous it should be answered that I
undertook the job, and it comes out to-day in a &lsquo;Letter to
Lockhart, in reply,&rsquo; &amp;c. I don&rsquo;t believe anybody read the
last I wrote, but as I have published this at Ridgway&rsquo;s, perhaps
it may have a more extensive sale. The events have
been the final passing of the Bill, after three nights&rsquo; debate,
by a majority of 116, ended by a very fine speech from Peel,
who has eminently distinguished himself through this fight.
Stanley closed the debate at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, with
what they say was a good and dexterous speech, but which
contained a very unnecessary dissertation about the Peers.
This, together with some words from Richmond and the
cheerfulness of Holland, makes my mind misgive me that we
shall still have them created for the Committee. The conduct
of the ultra-Tories has been so bad and so silly that I cannot
wish to bring them in, though I have a great desire to turn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">REFORM BILL IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</span>
the others out. As to a moderate party, it is a mere dream,
for where is the moderation? This day Lord John Russell
brings the Bill up to the House of Lords, and much indeed
depends upon what passes there. Harrowby and Wharncliffe
will make their speeches, and we shall, I conclude, have the
Duke and Lord Grey. I expect, and I beg his pardon if I am
wrong, that the Duke will make as mischievous a speech as
he can, and try to provoke declarations and pledges against
the Bill. The Ministers are exceedingly anxious that Harrowby
should confine himself to generalities, which I hope
too, for I am certain no good can, and much harm may, be
done by going into details. Grey, Holland, and Richmond all
three spoke to me about it last night, and I am going to see
what can be done with them. I should not fear Harrowby
but that he is petulant and sour; Wharncliffe is vain, and
has been excited in all this business, though with very good
and very disinterested motives, but he cannot bear patiently
the abuse and the ridicule with which both the extreme ends
endeavour to cover him, and he is uneasy under it, and what
I dread is that in making attempts to set himself right, and to
clear his character with a party who will never forgive him for
what he has done, and to whom whatever he says will be words
cast to the winds, he will flounder, and say something which
will elicit from Lord Grey some declaration that may make
matters worse than ever. What I hope and trust is that the
Government and our people will confine themselves to civil
generalities, and pledge themselves <i>de part et d&rsquo;autre</i> to nothing,
and that they will not be provoked by taunts from any
quarter to depart from that prudent course.</p>

<p>There was another breeze in the House of Lords about
Irish Education, the whole bench of bishops in a flame,
and except Maltby, who spoke <i>for</i>, all declared against the
plan&mdash;Phillpotts in a furious speech. What celestial influences
have been at work I know not, but certain it is that the
world seems going mad, individually and collectively. The
town has been more occupied this week with Dudley&rsquo;s extravagancies
than the affairs of Europe. He, in fact, is mad,
but is to be cupped and starved and disciplined sound again.
It has been fine talk for the town. The public curiosity and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
love of news is as voracious and universal as the appetite of a
shark, and, like it, loves best what is grossest and most disgusting;
anything relating to personal distress, to crime, to
passion, is greedily devoured by this monster, as Cowley calls it.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p style="text-indent: 0em">
But of all the examples of cant, hypocrisy, party violence, I
have never seen any to be compared to the Irish Education
business; and there was Rosslyn, an old Whig, voting against;
Carnarvon stayed away, every Tory without exception going
against the measure. As to madness, Dudley has gone mad
in his own house, Perceval in the House of Commons, and
John Montague in the Park, the two latter preaching, both
Irvingites and believers in &lsquo;the tongues.&rsquo; Dudley&rsquo;s madness
took an odd turn; he would make up all his quarrels with
Lady Holland, to whom he has not spoken for sixteen years,
and he called on her, and there were tears and embraces, and
God knows what. Sydney Smith told her that she was bound
in honour to set the quarrel up again when he comes to his
senses, and put things into the <i>status quo ante pacem</i>. It
would be hard upon him to find, on getting out of a strait
waistcoat, that he had been robbed of all his hatreds and hostilities,
and seduced into the house of his oldest foe.</p>

<h3>March 27th, 1832</h3>

<p>I did the Duke of Wellington an injustice.
He spoke, but without any violence, in a fair and gentlemanlike
manner, a speech creditable to himself, useful and becoming.
If there was any disposition on the part of his followers to
light a flame, he at once repressed it. The whole thing went
off well; House very full; Harrowby began, and made an excellent
speech, with the exception of one mistake. He dwelt
too much on the difference between this Bill and the last,
as if the difference of his own conduct resulted from that
cause, and this I could see they were taking up in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</span>
minds, and though he corrected the impression afterwards,
it will be constantly brought up against him, I have no
doubt. After him Carnarvon, who alone was violent, but short;
then Wharncliffe (I am not sure which was first of these two),
very short and rather embarrassed, expressing his concurrence
with Lord Harrowby; then the Bishop of London,
short also, but strong in his language, much more than Lord
Harrowby; then Lord Grey, temperate and very general,
harping a little too much on that confounded word <i>efficiency</i>,
denying that what he said last year bore the interpretation
that had been put upon it, and announcing that he would
give his best consideration to any amendments, a very good
speech; then the Duke, in a very handsome speech,
acknowledging that he was not against all Reform, though
he was against this Bill, because he did not think if it passed
it would be possible to carry on the government of the
country, but promising that if the Bill went into Committee
he would give his constant attendance, and do all in his
power to make it as safe a measure as possible. So finished
this important evening, much to the satisfaction of the moderate,
and to the disgust of the violent party. I asked Lord
Holland if he was satisfied (in the House after the debate),
and he said, &lsquo;Yes, yes, very well, but the Bishop&rsquo;s the man;&rsquo;
and in the evening at Lord Grey&rsquo;s I found they were all full
of the Bishop. Lord Grey said to me, &lsquo;Well, you will allow
that I behaved very well?&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;Yes, very, but the whole
thing was satisfactory, I think.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;on the whole,
but they were a little too strong, too violent against the
Bill,&rsquo; because Harrowby had declared that he felt the same
objection to the measure he had felt before. Sefton was
outrageous, talked a vast deal of amusing nonsense, &lsquo;that he
had never heard such twaddle,&rsquo; &lsquo;but that the success was complete,
and he looked on Harrowby and Wharncliffe as the two
most enviable men in the kingdom.&rsquo; I have no doubt that
all the ultras will be deeply mortified at the moderation of
Lord Grey and of the Duke of Wellington, and at the success
<i>so far</i> of &lsquo;the Waverers.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>March 28th, 1832</h3>

<p>There appear to have been as many differences
of opinion as of people on the discussion in the House of
Lords when the Bill was brought up, and it seems paradoxical,
but is true, that though it was on the whole satisfactory, nobody
was satisfied. Lord Grey complained to me that Lord
Harrowby was too stiff; Lord Harrowby complained that
Lord Grey was always beating about the bush of compromise,
but never would commit himself fairly to concession. Melbourne
complained last night that what was done was done in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD HARROWBY&rsquo;S PATRIOTIC CONDUCT.</span>
such an ungracious manner, so niggardly, that he hated the
man (Harrowby) who did it. The ultra-Tories are outrageous
&lsquo;that he gave up everything without reason or cause;&rsquo;
the ultra-Whigs equally furious &lsquo;that he had shown how
little way he was disposed to go in Committee; his object was
to turn out the Government;&rsquo; and what is comical, neither
party will believe that Harrowby really is so obnoxious to
the other as he is said to be. Each is convinced that he is
acting in the interests of the other. What a position, what
injustice, blindness, folly, obstinacy, brought together and
exhibited! If ever there was a man whose conduct was
exempt from the ordinary motives of ambition, and who
made personal sacrifices in what he is doing, it is Lord
Harrowby, and yet there is no reproach that is not cast upon
him, no term of abuse that is not applied to him, no motive
that is not ascribed to him. No wonder a man who has seen
much of them is sick of politics and public life. Nothing
now is thought of but the <i>lists</i>, and of course everybody has
got one. The Tories still pretend to a majority of seven;
the Government and Harrowby think they have one of from
ten to twenty, and I suspect fifteen will be found about the
mark. The unfortunate thing is that neither of our cocks is
good for fighting, not from want of courage, but Harrowby
is peevish, ungracious and unpopular, and Wharncliffe
carries no great weight. To be sure neither of them pretends
to make a party, but then their opponents insist upon
it that they do, and men shrink from enlisting (or being
supposed to enlist) under Wharncliffe&rsquo;s banner. However,
notwithstanding the violence of the noisy fools of the party,
and of the women, there is a more rational disposition on
the part of practical men, for Wharncliffe spoke to Ellenborough
yesterday, and told him that though he knew he
and Harrowby were regarded as traitors by all of them, he
did hope that when the Bill came into Committee they would
agree to consult together, and try and come to some understanding
as to the best mode of dealing with the question,
that it was absurd to be standing aloof at such a moment;
to which Ellenborough replied that he perfectly agreed with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
him, was anxious to do so, and intended to advise his friends
to take that course.</p>

<h3>April 1st, 1832</h3>

<p>Wharncliffe got Lord Grey to put off the
second reading for a few days on account of the Quarter
Sessions, which drew down a precious attack from Londonderry,
and was in fact very foolish and unnecessary, as it
looks like a concert between them, of which it is very desirable
to avoid any appearance, as in fact none exists. The
violence of the Tories continues unabated, and there is no
effort they do not make to secure a majority, and they expect
either to succeed or to bring it to a near thing. In the
meantime the tone of the other party is changed. Dover,
who makes lists, manages proxies, and does all the little
jobbing, whipping-in, busy work of the party, makes out a
clear majority, and told me he now thought the Bill would
get through without Peers. The Government, however, are
all agreed to make the Peers if it turns out to be necessary,
and especially if the Bill should be thrown out, it seems clear
that they would by no means go out, but make the Peers
and bring it in again; so I gather from Richmond, and he
who was the most violently opposed of the whole Cabinet to
Peer-making, is now ready to make any number if necessary.
There is, however, I hope, a disposition to concession, which,
if matters are tolerably well managed, may lead to an
arrangement. Still Wharncliffe, who must have a great deal
to do in Committee, is neither prudent nor popular. The
Tories are obstinate, sulky, and indisposed to agree to anything
reasonable. It is the unity of object and the compactness
of the party which give the Government strength.
Charles Wood told me the other day that they were well
disposed to a compromise on two special points, one the exclusion
of town voters from the right of voting for counties,
the other the metropolitan members. On the first he proposed
that no man voting for a town in right of a 10&#8467;. house
should have a vote for the county in right of any freehold in
that town. That would be half-way between Wharncliffe&rsquo;s
plan and the present. The second, that Marylebone should
return two members, and Middlesex two more&mdash;very like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CONVERSATION WITH LORD MELBOURNE.</span>
Grey&rsquo;s proposition which Harrowby rejected&mdash;but I suggested
keeping the whole and varying the qualification, to which he
thought no objection would lie.</p>

<p>At the Duchesse de Dino&rsquo;s ball the night before last I had
a very anxious conversation with Melbourne about it all.
He said that &lsquo;he really believed there was no strong feeling
in the country for the measure.&rsquo; We talked of the violence
of the Tories, and their notion that they could get rid of the
whole thing. I said the notion was absurd <i>now</i>, but that I
fully agreed with him about the general feeling. &lsquo;Why, then,&rsquo;
said he, &lsquo;might it not be thrown out?&rsquo;&mdash;a consummation I
really believe he would rejoice at, if it could be done. I said
because there was a great party which would not let it, which
would agitate again, and that the country wished ardently to
have it settled; that if it could be disposed of for good and
all, it would be a good thing indeed, but that this was now
become impossible. I asked him if his colleagues were impressed
as he was with this truth, and he said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; I told
him he ought to do everything possible to enforce it, and
to make them moderate, and induce them to concede, to
which he replied, &lsquo;What difficulty can they have in swallowing
the rest after they have given up the rotten boroughs?
That is, in fact, the essential part of the Bill, and the truth is
<i>I do not see how the Government is to be carried on without
them</i>. Some means may be found; a remedy may possibly
present itself, and it may work in practice better than we
now know of, but I am not aware of any, and I do not see
how any Government can be carried on when these are swept
away.&rsquo; This was, if not his exact words, the exact sense,
and a pretty avowal for a man to make at the eleventh hour
who has been a party concerned in this Bill during the other
ten. I told him I agreed in every respect, but that it was
too late to discuss this now, and that the rotten boroughs
were past saving, that as to the minor points, the Waverers
thought them of importance, looked upon them as securities,
compensations, and moreover as what would save their own
honour, and that the less their real importance was the more
easily might they be conceded. We had a great deal more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
talk, but then it is all talk, and <i>à quoi bon</i> with a man who
holds these opinions and acts as he does? Let it end as it
may, the history of the Bill, and the means by which it has
been conceived, brought forward, supported, and opposed, will
be most curious and instructive. The division in the Lords
must be very close indeed.</p>

his appearance a few days ago, a great burly Russian, but no

[Of the Belgian Treaty.]</p></div>

<p>I have refrained for a long time from writing down anything
about the cholera, because the subject is intolerably
disgusting to me, and I have been bored past endurance by
the perpetual questions of every fool about it. It is not,
however, devoid of interest. In the first place, what has
happened here proves that &lsquo;the people&rsquo; of this enlightened,
reading, thinking, reforming nation are not a whit less barbarous
than the serfs in Russia, for precisely the same prejudices
have been shown here that were found at St. Petersburg
and at Berlin. The disease has undoubtedly appeared
(hitherto) in this country in a milder shape than elsewhere,
but the alarm at its name was so great that the Government
could do no otherwise than take such precautions and means
of safety as appeared best to avert the danger or mitigate its
consequences. Here it came, and the immediate effect was
a great inconvenience to trade and commerce, owing to
restrictions, both those imposed by foreigners generally on
this country and those we imposed ourselves between the
healthy and unhealthy places. This begot complaints and
disputes, and professional prejudices and jealousies urged a
host of combatants into the field, to fight about the existence
or non-existence of cholera, its contagiousness, and any collateral
question. The disposition of the public was (and is)
to believe that the whole thing was a humbug, and accordingly
plenty of people were found to write in that sense, and
the press lent itself to propagate the same idea. The disease,
however, kept creeping on, the Boards of Health which were
everywhere established immediately became odious, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE CHOLERA IN ENGLAND.</span>
vestries and parishes stoutly resisted all pecuniary demands
for the purpose of carrying into effect the recommendations
of the Central Board or the orders of the Privy Council. In
this town the mob has taken the part of the anti-cholerites,
and the most disgraceful scenes have occurred. The other
day a Mr. Pope, head of the hospital in Marylebone (Cholera
Hospital) came to the Council Office to complain that a
patient who was being removed with his own consent had
been taken out of his chair by the mob and carried back,
the chair broken, and the bearers and surgeon hardly
escaping with their lives. Furious contests have taken place
about the burials, it having been recommended that bodies
should be burned directly after death, and the most violent
prejudice opposing itself to this recommendation; in short,
there is no end to the scenes of uproar, violence, and brutal
ignorance that have gone on, and this on the part of the
lower orders, for whose especial benefit all the precautions
are taken, and for whose relief large sums have been raised
and all the resources of charity called into activity in every
part of the town. The awful thing is the vast extent of
misery and distress which prevails, and the evidence of the
rotten foundation on which the whole fabric of this gorgeous
society rests, for I call that rotten which exhibits thousands
upon thousands of human beings reduced to the lowest stage
of moral and physical degradation, with no more of the necessaries
of life than serve to keep body and soul together,
whole classes of artisans without the means of subsistence.
However complicated and remote the causes of this state of
things, the manifestations present themselves in a frightful
presence and reality, and those whose ingenuity, and experience,
and philosophical views may enable them accurately to
point out the causes and the gradual increase of this distress
are totally unable to suggest a remedy or to foresee an end
to it. Can such a state of things permanently go on? can
any reform ameliorate it? Is it possible for any country to
be considered in a healthy condition when there is no such
thing as a <i>general</i> diffusion of the comforts of life (varying of
course with every variety of circumstance which can affect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the prosperity of individuals or of classes), but when the extremes
prevail of the most unbounded luxury and enjoyment
and the most dreadful privation and suffering? To imagine
a state of society in which everybody should be well off, or
even tolerably well off, would be a mere vision, as long as
there is a preponderance of vice and folly in the world.
There will always be effects commensurate with their causes,
but it has not always been, and it certainly need not be, that
the majority of the population should be in great difficulty,
struggling to keep themselves afloat, and, what is worse, in
uncertainty and in doubt whether they can earn subsistence
for themselves and their families. Such is the case at present,
and I believe a general uncertainty pervades every class
of society, from the highest to the lowest; nobody looks upon
any institution as secure, or any interest as safe, and it is only
because those universal feelings of alarm which are equally
diffused throughout the mass but slightly affect each individual
atom of it that we see the world go on as usual, eating,
drinking, laughing, and dancing, and not insensible to the
danger, though, apparently indifferent about it.</p>

<h3>April 4th, 1832</h3>

<p>Charles Wood<a name="FNA_18_02" id="FNA_18_02"></a><a href="#FN_18_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
came to me yesterday, and
brought a paper showing the various effects of a different
qualification from 10&#8467;. to 40&#8467;. for the metropolitan districts,
to talk over the list, but principally to get me to speak to
Harrowby about a foreseen difficulty. The first clause in
the Bill enacts <i>that fifty-six boroughs be disfranchised</i>. This
gave great offence in the House of Commons, was feebly
defended, but carried by the majority, which was always
ready and required no reason; it was an egregious piece
of folly and arrogance there, here it presents a real embarrassment.
I told him I knew Harrowby had an invincible
repugnance to it, and that the effect would be very bad if
they split upon the first point. He said he should not defend
it, that all reason was against it, but that there it was,
and how was it to be got rid of? I suggested that it should
be passed over, and that they should go at once to the boroughs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">A DIFFICULTY AT SCHEDULE A.</span>
<i>seriatim</i>. He said if that clause was omitted a suspicion
would immediately arise that there was an intention of
altering Schedule A, and nothing would avert that but
getting through a great part of it before Easter, and that this
might be difficult, as the longest time they could expect to sit
would be three days in Passion Week. He talked a great
deal about the country expecting this, and that they would
not be satisfied if it was not done, and all the usual jargon
of the Reformers, which it was not worth while to dispute,
and it ended by my promising to talk to Lord Harrowby
about it. This I did last night, and he instantly flew into
a rage. He said &lsquo;he would not be dragged through the
mire by those scoundrels. It was an insolence that was
not to be borne; let them make their Peers if they would, not
Hell itself should make him vote for <i>fifty-six</i>; he would vote
for sixty-six or any number but that, that he would not split
with the Tories on the first vote; if indeed <i>they</i> would consent
to fifty-six he would, or to anything else they would agree
to, but if the Government brought this forward no consideration
on earth should prevent his opposing it.&rsquo; We then
discussed the whole matter, with the proposed amendments
which Wood and I had talked over with reference to the
metropolitan members and town and county voting, and I am
to go to-day and propose that after the second reading is
carried they should adjourn till after Easter, and give a little
time for the excitement (which there must be) to subside, and
to see how matters stand, and what probability there is of
getting the thing through quietly.</p>

[Mr. Charles Wood, afterwards Viscount Halifax, but at this time
private Secretary to Earl Grey, whose daughter he married.]</p></div>

<h3>April 6th, 1832</h3>

<p>I called on the Duke of Richmond on Wednesday
morning, and told him what had passed between Wood
and me, and Lord Harrowby and me afterwards. He was
aware of the difficulty, and regretted it the more because he
might have to defend it in the House of Lords. He wished
me very much to go to Downing Street and see Lord Grey
himself if possible before the levee, and he suggested that the
words fifty-six might be left in blank by Lord Grey&rsquo;s own
motion, that this would be in conformity with the forms of the
House. I set off, but calling at home on my way found Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
Harrowby at my door. He came in, and was anxious to know
if I had said anything; he was more quiet than the night before,
but still resolved not to agree to fifty-six, though anxious
to have the matter compromised in some way. Lord Harrowby
wanted to adjourn after the second reading, but owned that
the best effect would be to get through Schedule A before
Easter. Yesterday I saw Wood; he harped upon the difficulty
and the old strain of the country. I suggested the point of
form which Richmond had mentioned, but he said that could
not be <i>now</i> in the Bill, as it was sent up from the Commons,
that if they were beaten on fifty-six the country would consider
it tantamount to throwing out Schedule A, and would highly
approve of a creation of Peers, and that, in fact (if they
wished it), it would be the best opportunity they could have.
I told him that it would heap ridicule upon all the antecedent
proceedings, and the pretext must be manifest, as it would
appear in the course of the discussions what the real reason
was. In the middle of our conversation Ellice came in, and
directly asked if my friends would swallow fifty-six, to which
I said, &lsquo;No.&rsquo; We had then a vehement dispute, but at last
Wood turned him out, and he and I resumed. We finally
agreed that I should ask Lord Harrowby whether, if Lord
Grey of his own accord proposed to leave out the words fifty-six,
but with an expression of his opinion that this must be
the number, he (Lord Harrowby) would meet him with a
corresponding declaration that he objected to the specification
of the number in the clause, without objecting to the
extent of the disfranchisement, it being always understood
that what passes between us is unauthorised talk, and to
commit nobody&mdash;&lsquo;without prejudice,&rsquo; as the lawyers say.</p>

<p>I heard yesterday, however, from Keate, who is attending
me (and who is the King&rsquo;s surgeon, and sees him when
he is in town), that he saw his Majesty after the levee on
Wednesday, and that he was ill, out of sorts, and in considerable
agitation; that he enquired of him about his health,
when the King said he had much to annoy him, and that
&lsquo;many things passed there (pointing to the Cabinet, out of
which he had just come) which were by no means agreeable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING&rsquo;S RELUCTANCE TO MAKE PEERS.</span>
and that he had had more than usual to occupy him that
morning.&rsquo; Keate said he was very sure from his manner
that something unpleasant had occurred. This was, I have
since discovered, the question of a creation of Peers again
brought forward, and to which the King&rsquo;s aversion has returned
so much so that it is doubtful if he will after all
consent to a large one. It seems that unless the Peers are
made (in the event of the necessity arising) Brougham and
Althorp will resign; at least so they threaten. I have seen
enough of threats, and doubts, and scruples, to be satisfied
that there is no certainty that any of them will produce
the anticipated effects, but I am resolved I will try, out of
these various elements, if I cannot work out something which
may be serviceable to the cause itself, though the materials
I have to work with are scanty. The Ministers were all day
yesterday settling who the new Peers shall be, so seriously
are they preparing for the <i>coup</i>. They had already fixed
upon Lords Molyneux, Blandford, Kennedy, Ebrington,
Cavendish, Brabazon, and Charles Fox, Littleton, Portman,
Frederick Lawley, Western, and many others, and this would
be what Lord Holland calls assimilating the House of Lords
to the spirit of the other House, and making it harmonise
with the prevailing sense of the people.</p>

<h3>April 8th, 1832</h3>

<p>Lord Harrowby was out of town when I called
there on Friday, so I wrote to him the substance of my conversation
with Wood. Yesterday he returned. In the evening
I met Wood at dinner at Lord Holland&rsquo;s, when he told me
that he found on the part of his friends more reluctance than
he had expected to give up the fifty-six, that he had done
all he could to persuade them, but they made great objections.
Moreover he had had a conversation with Sandon which he did
not quite like, as he talked so much of holding the party together.
All this was to make me think they are stouter than
they really are, for I am better informed than he thinks for.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning I got more correct information about
what had passed with the King. Lord Grey went to him
with a minute of Cabinet requiring that he should make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
Peers in case the second reading was thrown
out.<a name="FNA_18_03" id="FNA_18_03"></a><a href="#FN_18_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
To this
he demurred, raised difficulties and doubts, which naturally
enough alarm the Government very much. However, when
he got back to Windsor he wrote two letters, explaining his
sentiments, from which it appears that he has great reluctance,
that he will do it, but will not give any pledge beforehand,
that he objects to increasing the Peerage, and wants to call
up eldest sons and make Irish and Scotch Peers, that he did
not say positively he would make the Peers, but that he
would be in the way, and come up when it was necessary.
They think that he has some idea that his pledging himself
beforehand (though in fact he did so two months ago) might
be drawn into an improper precedent. However this may
be, his reluctance is so strong that a great deal may be
made of it, as it is probable (if he continues in the same
mind, and is not turned by some violence of the Opposition)
that he will resist still more making Peers when the Bill is
in Committee to carry the details, some of which he himself
wishes to see altered, but the difficulty is very great. It is
impossible to communicate with the Tory leaders; they will
not believe what you tell them, and if they learnt the King&rsquo;s
scruples they would immediately imagine that they might
presume upon them to any extent, and stand out more
obstinately than ever. I went to Harrowby last night, and
imparted to him the state of things, which I shall do to
nobody else. To Wharncliffe I dare not. He is not indisposed
to Wood&rsquo;s compromise, and I trust this will be settled,
but he still leans to putting off the second reading till after
Easter, and if the Tories also resolve upon that (which they
are mightily disposed to do) he will not separate from them
on that point, and they are sure to carry it. Unless this
was accompanied with some declaration from them that
they would be disposed to concede the great principles of
the Bill, I think the Government would consider it such an
indication of hostility as to call for an immediate creation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">&lsquo;THE HUNCHBACK.&rsquo;</span>
of Peers, and I doubt whether the King could or would
resist. There are many reasons why it would be desirable
to make the second reading a resting-place, and adjourn then
till after Easter, provided all parties consented, but it would
be very unwise to make it the subject of a contest, and nobody
would ever believe that the real reason was not to get
rid of Schedule A by hook or by crook, or of a good deal of
it. Harrowby will, I am sure, not divide against them on
this, and they will not give it up; that there are means of
resistance, if they were judiciously applied, I am sure, and
if there were temper, discretion, and cordiality, the Bill
might be licked into a very decent shape.</p>

upon it, have been printed in the &lsquo;Correspondence of William IV. and Earl
Grey,&rsquo; vol. ii. p. 307.]</p></div>

<p>I went to see Sheridan Knowles&rsquo; new play the other
night, &lsquo;The Hunchback.&rsquo; Very good, and a great success.
Miss Fanny Kemble acted really well&mdash;for the first time, in
my opinion, great acting. I have not seen anything since
Mrs. Siddons (and perhaps Miss O&rsquo;Neill) so good.</p>

<p>The Duke of Wellington made a very good speech on
Irish affairs on Friday, one of his best, and he speaks
admirably <i>to points</i> sometimes and on subjects he understands.
I wish he had let alone that Irish Education&mdash;disgraceful
humbug and cant. I don&rsquo;t know that there is anything
else particularly new. Orloff is made a great rout with, but
he don&rsquo;t ratify. The real truth is that the King of Holland
holds out, and the other Powers delay till they see the result
of our Reform Bill, thinking that the Duke of Wellington
may return to power, and then they may make better terms
for Holland and dictate to Belgium and to France. If the
Reform Bill is carried, and Government stays in, they will
ratify, and not till then. The cholera is disappearing here
and in the country.</p>

<h3>April 9th, 1832</h3>

<p>Saw Lord Harrowby yesterday morning. He
can&rsquo;t make up his mind what is best to be done, whether to go
into Committee or not. He rather wishes to get through
Schedule A, but he won&rsquo;t vote against the Tories if they
divide on adjourning. Then went to Wood and told him
there would be no difficulty about <i>fifty-six</i>. Lord Grey
came in, and talked the whole thing over. He said he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
was ill&mdash;knocked up&mdash;that in his speech to-day he should
be as moderate and tame as anybody could wish. From
what Wood said, and he himself afterwards, I should
think they wish to adjourn after the second reading, but to
make a merit of it if they do. Duncannon, whom I saw
afterwards, seemed to be of the same opinion, that it would
be best not to sit in Passion Week. At night Wharncliffe
came back from Yorkshire. He is all for getting into
Schedule A, and making no difficulties about fifty-six or
anything else, and Harrowby, now that he fancies the Government
want to adjourn, rather wants not, suspecting some
trick. Upon going all over the list, we make out the worst
to give a majority of six, and the best of eighteen, but the
Tories still count upon getting back some of our people. We
had a grand hunt after Lord Gambier&rsquo;s proxy; he sent it to
Lord de Saumarez, who is laid up with the gout in Guernsey,
and the difficulty was to get at Lord Gambier and procure
another. At last I made Harrowby, who does not know
him, write to him, and Wood sent a messenger after him,
so we hope it will arrive in time.</p>

<h3>April 11th, 1832</h3>

<p>The day before yesterday Lord Grey introduced
the Reform Bill in a speech of extreme moderation; as
he promised, it was very &lsquo;tame.&rsquo; The night&rsquo;s debate was dull;
yesterday was better. Lord Mansfield made a fine speech
against the Bill; Harrowby spoke well, Wharncliffe ill.
Nothing can equal the hot water we have been in&mdash;defections
threatened on every side, expectations thwarted and doubts
arising, betting nearly even. Even de Ros came to me in
the morning and told me he doubted how he should vote; that
neither Harrowby nor Wharncliffe had put the question on
the proper ground, and his reason for seceding from the
Opposition was the menaced creation of Peers. I wrote to
Harrowby and begged him to say something to satisfy tender
consciences, and moved heaven and earth to keep De Ros
and Coventry (who was slippery) right, and I succeeded&mdash;at
least I believe so, for it is not yet over. Nothing can equal
the anxiety out of doors and the intensity of the interest in
the town, but the debate is far less animated than that of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">REFORM BILL CARRIED IN THE HOUSE OF LORDS.</span>
last year. As to our business, it is &lsquo;la mer à boire,&rsquo; with
nobody to canvass or whip in, and not being a party. We
shall, however, I believe, manage it, and but just.</p>

<p>I saw Keate this morning, who had been with the King.
His Majesty talked in high terms of Ellenborough and of
Mansfield. It is difficult to count upon such a man, but if the
second reading is passed I do not believe he will make Peers
to carry any points in Committee, unless it be the very vital
ones, but it is very questionable if the Opposition will fight
the battle then at all, or, if they do, fight in a way to secure
a fair, practical result.</p>

<h3>April 14th, 1832</h3>

<p>The Reform Bill (second reading) was
carried this morning at seven o&rsquo;clock in the House of Lords
by a majority of nine. The House did not sit yesterday.
The night before Phillpotts, the Bishop of Exeter, made a
grand speech against the Bill, full of fire and venom, very
able. It would be an injury to compare this man with Laud;
he more resembles Gardiner; had he lived in those days he
would have been just such another, boiling with ambition,
an ardent temperament, and great talents. He has a desperate
and a dreadful countenance, and looks like the man he
is. The two last days gave plenty of reports of changes
either way, but the majority has always looked like from
seven to ten. The House will adjourn on Wednesday, and
go into Committee after Easter; and in the meantime what
negotiations and what difficulties to get over! The Duke of
Wellington and Lord Harrowby have had some good-humoured
talk, and the former seems well disposed to join
in amending the Bill, but the difficulty will be to bring these
extreme and irritated parties to any agreement as to terms.
The debate in the Lords, though not so good as last year,
has been, as usual, much better than that in the Commons.</p>

<p>The accounts from Paris of the cholera are awful, very
different from the disease here. Is it not owing to our
superior cleanliness, draining, and precautions? There have
been 1,300 sick in a day there, and for some days an average
of 1,000; here we have never averaged above fifty, I think,
and, except the squabbling in the newspapers, we have seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
nothing of it whatever; there many of the upper classes have
died of it. Casimir Périer and the Duke of Orleans went to
the Hotel Dieu, and the former was seized afterwards, and has
been very ill, though they doubt if it really was cholera, as he
is subject to attacks with the same symptoms.</p>

<h3>April 15th, 1832</h3>

<p>The debate in the House of Lords was closed
by a remarkable reply from Lord Grey, full of moderation,
and such as to hold out the best hopes of an adjustment of
the question&mdash;not that it pacified the ultra-Tories, who were
furious. The speech was so ill reported at that late hour
that it is not generally known what he did say, and many of
those who heard it almost doubt their own accuracy, or
suspect that he went further than he intended, so unlike was
it to his former violent and unyielding language. He said,
with regard to a creation of Peers, that nothing would justify
him in recommending the exercise of that prerogative but a
collision between the two Houses of Parliament, and that in
such a case (he is reported to have said) he should deem it
his duty first to recommend a dissolution, and to ascertain
whether the feeling of the country was with the other House
(these were not the words, but to this effect). If this be at
all correct, it is clear that he cannot make Peers to carry
the clauses, for, in fact, the collision between the two Houses
will not have arrived unless the Commons should reject any
amendments which may be made by the Lords. The tone,
however, of the violent supporters of Government is totally
changed; at Lord Holland&rsquo;s last night they were singing in
a very different note, and, now, if the councils of the Lords
are guided by moderation and firmness, they may deal with
the Bill <i>almost</i> as they please; but they must swallow
Schedule A. The difficulties, however, are great; the High
Tories are exasperated and vindictive, and will fiercely fight
against any union with the seceders. The Duke is moderate
in his tone, ready to act cordially with all parties, but he
owes the seceders a grudge, is anxious to preserve his influence
with the Tories, and will probably insist upon
mutilating the Bill more than will be prudent and feasible.
The Harrowby and Wharncliffe party, now that the second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD WHARNCLIFFE AND LORD HARROWBY.</span>
reading <ins class="correction" title = "text reads &lsquo;it&rsquo;">is</ins> over,
ceases to be a party. It was a patched-up,
miscellaneous concern at best, of men who were half
reasoned, half frightened over, who could not bear separating
from the Duke, long to return to him, and, besides, are
ashamed of Wharncliffe as a chief. There never was such a
&lsquo;chef de circonstance.&rsquo; He is a very honest man, with a
right view of things and a fair and unprejudiced understanding,
vain and imprudent, without authority, commanding
no respect, and in a false position as the ephemeral leader
he is, marching in that capacity <i>pari passu</i> with Harrowby,
who is infinitely more looked up to, but whose bilious complexion
prevents his mixing with society and engaging and
persuading others to follow his opinions; nor has he (Lord
Harrowby) any plan or design beyond the object of the moment.
He has no thought of mixing again in public life, he
does not propose to communicate with anybody on anything
further than the middle course to be adopted now, and few
people are disposed to sever the ties on which their future
political existence depends for the sake of cultivating this
short-lived connection. If the Government, therefore, looks
to the seceders who have carried the question for them to
carry other points, they will find it won&rsquo;t do, for their
followers will melt into the mass of the anti-Reformers, who,
though they will still frown upon the chiefs, will gladly take
back the rank and file. A fortnight will elapse, in the course
of which opportunities will be found of ascertaining the disposition
of the great party and the probability of an arrangement.</p>

<p>The debate was good on Friday, but very inferior to the
last. Phillpotts got a terrific dressing from Lord Grey, and
was handled not very delicately by Goderich and Durham,
though the latter was too coarse. He had laid himself very
open, and, able as he is, he has adopted a tone and style
inconsistent with his lawn sleeves, and unusual on the
Episcopal Bench. He is carried away by his ambition and
his alarm, and horrifies his brethren, who feel all the danger
(in these times) of such a colleague. The episode of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
he was the object was, of course, the most amusing part of
the whole.</p>

<h3>Newmarket, April 22nd, 1832</h3>

<p>Ill and laid up with the gout
for this week past. Came here on Friday, the 20th. The
carrying of the second reading of the Bill seems to have
produced no effect. Everybody is gone out of town, the
Tories in high dudgeon. The Duke of Wellington has
entered a protest with all the usual objections, which has
been signed by a whole rabble of Peers, but not by Lyndhurst,
Ellenborough, or Carnarvon, who monopolise the brains of the
party; they declined. In the meantime things look better.
Wharncliffe, Harrowby, and Haddington have had two interviews
with Lyndhurst and Ellenborough, and though they
did not go into particulars the result was satisfactory, and
a strong disposition evinced to co-operation and moderation.
It was agreed they should meet again next week, and see
what could be arranged. On Friday Palmerston sent to
Wharncliffe and desired to see him. They met, and Palmerston
told him that he came from Lord Grey, who was
desirous of having an interview with him, adding that Lord
Grey had now become convinced that he might make much
more extensive concessions than he had ever yet contemplated.
He added that Lord Grey would rather see Wharncliffe
alone, without Harrowby, whose manner was so snappish
and unpleasant that he could not talk so much at his ease
as he would to Wharncliffe alone. Wharncliffe replied that
he could have no objection to see Lord Grey, but that he
must fairly tell him his situation was no longer the same,
having put himself in amicable communication with Lyndhurst
and Ellenborough; that the concurrence of the Tories
was indispensable to him and his friends to effect the alterations
they contemplated, and he could not do anything which
might have to them the appearance of underhand dealing;
that he could tell Lyndhurst and Ellenborough, and if they
made no objection he would see Lord Grey. Ellenborough
was gone out of town, but he went to Lyndhurst, who immediately
advised him to see Lord Grey, and said it was
most desirable they should be made acquainted with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MEETING OF LORD GREY AND LORD WHARNCLIFFE.</span>
views and disposition of Government, and he undertook to
write word to the Duke of Wellington of all that had passed.
Lord Grey was unable to leave Sheen yesterday, so it was
arranged that the meeting should be delayed till Wharncliffe&rsquo;s
return to London. The Duke of Richmond has, however, got
a letter of four sides from Grey, empowering him to treat here
with Wharncliffe, and Stanley and Graham being expected, it
is very likely some progress may be made. Nothing can
promise better, and if the chiefs of the Tories can be brought
to moderation the stupid obstinacy of the mass will not
matter, and I do not think they will dare hold out, for when
a negotiation on such a conciliatory basis is proposed, a
terrible case would be made hereafter against those who should
refuse to listen to it. The advantages are so clear that
nothing would make them persist in the line of uncompromising
opposition but an unconquerable repugnance to afford
a triumph to the Waverers, which a successful termination
would do; not that they would profit by it, for they are so
few, and those who will have been wrong so many, that
clamour will silence justice, and a thousand excuses and
pretences will be found to deprive them of their rightful
credit. It is a long time&mdash;not probably since the days of
Charles II.&mdash;that this place (Newmarket) has been the
theatre of a political negotiation, and, conceding the importance
of the subject, the actors are amusing&mdash;Richmond,
Graham, Wharncliffe, and myself. By-the-bye it is perfectly
true that (if I have not mentioned it before) the Royal
carriages were all ready the morning of the decision of the
second reading to take the King to the House of Lords to
prorogue Parliament, and on Tuesday the Peers would have
appeared in the &lsquo;Gazette.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>London, May 12th, 1832</h3>

<p>Nothing written for a long time,
nor had I anything to write till a few days ago. From the
time of Wharncliffe&rsquo;s departure I heard nothing, and I bitterly
regret now not having been in town last
week.<a name="FNA_18_04" id="FNA_18_04"></a><a href="#FN_18_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The Committee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
stood for Monday; on Friday se&rsquo;nnight last I was
at Buckenham, when the Duke of Rutland told me he was
going to London, that they meant to divide on Monday on
a proposal to postpone Schedules A and B till after C and
D, and expected to beat the Government; I wrote by that
post to Lady Harrowby, saying I hoped this was not true,
and that if it was it appeared to me most injudicious. On
Tuesday I received by the post a letter from Wharncliffe,
saying that they had been in frequent communication with
Ellenborough and Lyndhurst, that the Opposition were prepared
to make great and satisfactory concessions, and he
thought all would go off well. The only difficulty he apprehended
was from the postponement of the disfranchising
clause, which the Tories insisted on, and to which he and
Harrowby had thought it right to agree. The next day I
received a second letter, with an account of the debate and
its consequences, to which I wrote him a trimming reply,
and another to Lady Harrowby, expressing my sentiments
on their conduct on the occasion. Before all this happened
Wharncliffe had had to encounter abuse of every kind, and
he has certainly continued to play his cards in such a way,
from first to last, as to quarrel with Whigs and Tories in succession.
With very good intentions, and very honest, he has
exposed himself to every reproach of insincerity, intrigue,
and double-dealing.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_18_04" id="FN_18_04"></a><a href="#FNA_18_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[It was on the 7th of May that the Lords went into Committee on the
Bill, and Lord Lyndhurst&rsquo;s motion to postpone the <i>dis</i>franchising clauses
until after the <i>en</i>franchising clauses had been agreed to was carried by a
majority of thirty-five against the Government. The seventeen Peers who
had assisted to carry the second reading on the 11th of April relapsed into
the Conservative ranks, and the result was, for the moment, such as to stop
the progress of the Bill and turn out the Government.]</p></div>

<p>On arriving in town I found a note from him, desiring
I would see him and hear his defence of himself before I
expressed elsewhere the opinion I had given to him. Accordingly
I went to Boodle&rsquo;s, where I found him, and he
immediately began his case. He said that on his return to
town he saw Lord Grey, who said that he wished to know
what were the intentions of his party, and how far they
were disposed to go, and what concessions they looked for.
He replied that Lord Grey must understand that he now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEFEAT OF GOVERNMENT IN COMMITTEE.</span>
stood in a very different position, and that, reunited as he
was with the Tories, he must act with them&mdash;much, in
short, what he had before said to Palmerston. They then
discussed the question, and he said that there was one point
for which Lord Grey ought to be prepared, and that he knew
the Tories were much bent upon proposing the postponement
of Schedules A and B. Lord Grey said this would be productive
of the greatest embarrassment, that it would be a
thing they could not agree to, and he hoped he would do all
in his power to prevent it. Wharncliffe said that he would
endeavour, but he believed they were very eager about it,
and he added that Lord Grey might be sure <i>he</i> would support
nothing calculated to interfere with the essential provisions
of the Bill. After this his and Harrowby&rsquo;s communications
with Ellenborough and his friends continued, and on
the Saturday (I think) Lyndhurst told him that the Tories
were so irrevocably bent upon this, and that they were so
difficult to manage and so disposed to fly off, that it was
absolutely necessary to give way to them, and it must be
proposed, though he would gladly have waived it, but that
was impossible; upon which Harrowby and Wharncliffe
gave in and agreed to support it. One of them (Haddington,
I think) suggested that Wharncliffe ought to communicate
this intention to Lord Grey, to which, however, Lyndhurst
objected, said that the Tories were suspicious, had already
taken umbrage at the communications between Wharncliffe
and Grey, and that it must not be. To this prohibition
Wharncliffe fatally submitted, and accordingly not a word
was said by anybody till the afternoon of the debate, when
just before it began Wharncliffe told the Duke of Richmond,
who of course told Lord Grey. Wharncliffe at the same time
had some conversation with John Russell and Stanley, who
strongly deprecated this intention, but it was too late to
arrange or compromise anything then. The debate came on;
the proposition was made in a very aggravating speech by
Lyndhurst, and on its being carried Lord Grey threw up the
Bill and the Government in a passion. It is the more remarkable
that they should have taken this course at once, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
they certainly had very strong reason to doubt whether the
King would consent to a creation of Peers, though they probably
thought he might be bullied upon an occasion which
they fancied they could turn to great account; but he was
stout and would not hear of it.</p>

<p>The day after the debate Grey and Brougham went down
to Windsor and proposed to the King to make fifty Peers.
They took with them a minute of Cabinet signed by all the
members except the Duke of Richmond. Palmerston proposed
it in Cabinet, and Melbourne made no objection. His
Majesty took till the next day to consider, when he accepted
their resignations, which was the alternative they gave him.
At the levee the same day nothing occurred; the King
hardly spoke to the Duke, but he afterwards saw Lyndhurst
(having sent for him). I do not know what passed between
them, but the Duke of Wellington was soon sent for. The
Duke and Lyndhurst endeavoured to prevail on Peel to take
the Government upon himself, and the former offered to act
in any capacity in which he could be useful, but Peel would
not. Some communication also took place between Lyndhurst
and Harrowby, but the latter declared at once he would
support the new Government, but not take office. When Peel
finally declined, the Duke accepted, and yesterday at three
o&rsquo;clock he went to St. James&rsquo;s. The King saw Peel and the
Speaker. Nothing is known of the formation of the Cabinet,
but the reports were first that Alexander Baring was to be
Chancellor of the Exchequer, and since that he has refused
on account of his health, and that Lyndhurst is to go to the
King&rsquo;s Bench, Tenterden to retire, and the Great Seal to be
put in commission.</p>

<p>The first act of the Duke was to advise the King to reject
the address of the Birmingham Union, which he did, and
said he knew of no such body. All very proper. In the
morning I called upon Wood at the Treasury, to explain to
him that I had never been cognisant of the late proceedings
in the House of Lords, and that I was far from approving the
conduct of my old associates. He said he had never believed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">POSITION OF PARTIES.</span>
that I was any party to it, and regretted that I had not been
in town, when it was just possible I might have persuaded
them of the unworthiness of the course they were taking.
He said that I did not know how bad it was, for that
Wharncliffe had distinctly said that if such a thing was proposed
he should oppose it, and that Palmerston was present
when he said so. This Wharncliffe positively denies, and
yesterday he went to Palmerston to endeavour to explain,
taking with him a minute which he said he had drawn up at the
time of all that passed, but which he had never before shown
or submitted for correction, and which Palmerston told him
was incorrect, inasmuch, as it omitted that engagement.
They are at issue as to the fact. The position of the respective
parties is curious. The Waverers undertook a task
of great difficulty with slender means, and they accomplished
it with complete success. All turned out as they expected
and desired, but, after having been in confidential communication
with both parties, they have contrived mortally to
offend both, and to expose themselves to odium from every
quarter, and to an universal imputation of insincerity and
double-dealing, and this without any other fault than mismanagement
and the false position in which they found
themselves, without influence or power, between two mighty
parties. The Tories, who have exhibited nothing but obstinacy
and unreasonableness, and who thwarted the Waverers
by every means they could devise, have reaped all the benefit
of their efforts, and that without admitting that they
were right or thanking them for bringing matters to this
pass. They are triumphant, in spite of all they did to prevent
their own triumph, and have had all the spiteful
pleasure of abuse and obloquy, all the glory of consistency,
and the satisfaction of pertinacity, with all the advantages
that an opposite line of conduct promised to give them.
[Their triumph was of short duration, and nothing so complete
as their final discomfiture.]</p>

<p>The King took leave of his Ministers with a great effusion
of tenderness, particularly to Richmond, whom he entreated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
to remain in office; but I take it that he easily consoles himself,
and does not care much more for one Minister than
another.</p>

<p>The debate in the House of Commons was not so violent
as might have been expected, and the Tories were greatly
elated with the divisions on Ebrington&rsquo;s motion, because there
was a majority less by fifty-six than on a similar motion
when the Bill was rejected in October. The circumstances
were, however, different, and some would not vote because
they disapprove of creating Peers, which this vote would
have committed them to approve of. There is so much of
wonder, and curiosity, and expectation abroad that there is
less of abuse and exasperation than might have been expected,
but it will all burst forth. The town is fearfully quiet.
What is odd enough is that the King was hissed as he left
London the other day, and the Duke cheered as he came out of
the Palace. There have been some meetings, with resolutions
to support the Bill, to express approbation of the Ministers,
and to protest against the payment of taxes, and there will
probably be a good deal of bustle and bluster here and elsewhere;
but I do not believe in real tumults, particularly when
the rabble and the unions know that there is a Government
which will not stand such things, and that they will not be able
to bandy compliments with the Duke as they did with Althorp
and John Russell, not but what much dissatisfaction and much
disquietude must prevail. The funds have not fallen, which
is a sign that there is no alarm in the City. At this early
period of the business it is difficult to form any opinion of
what will happen; the present Government in opposition
will again be formidable, but I am disposed to think things
will go on and right themselves; we shall avoid a creation of
Peers, but we must have a Reform Bill of some sort, and perhaps
a harmless one after all, and if the elements of disorder
can be resolved into tranquillity and order again, we must
not quarrel with the means that have been employed, nor
the quantum of moral injustice that has been perpetrated.</p>

<p>The Tories are very indignant with Peel for not taking
office, and if, as it is supposed, he is to support Government
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PEEL REFUSES TO TAKE OFFICE.</span>
and the Bill out of office, and when all is over come in, it is
hardly worth while for such a farce to deprive the King and
the country of his services in the way that they could be
most useful, but he is still smarting under Catholic question
reminiscences, while the Duke is more thick-skinned. After
he had carried the Catholic question the world was prepared
for a good deal of versatility on his part, but it was in mere
derision that (after his speech on Reform in 1830) it used to
be said that he would very likely be found proposing a Bill of
Reform, and here he is coming into office for the express
purpose of carrying on this very Bill against which the other
day he entered a protest which must stare him in the face
through the whole progress of it, or, if not, to bring in
another of the same character, and probably nearly of the
same dimensions. Pretexts are, however, not wanting, and
the necessity of supporting the King is made paramount to
every other consideration. The Duke&rsquo;s worshippers (a numerous
class) call this the finest action of his life, though it is
difficult to perceive in what the grandeur of it consists, or
the magnitude of the sacrifice. However, it is fair to wait
a little, and hear from his own lips his exposition of the mode
in which he intends to deal with this measure, and how he
will reconcile what he has hitherto said with what he is now
about to do. Talleyrand is of course in a state of great
consternation, which will be communicated like an electrical
shock to the Powers specially favoured and protected by the
late Government&mdash;Leopold and Don Pedro, for instance. It
will be a difficult thing for the Duke to deal with some of
the questions on which he has committed himself pretty considerably
while in opposition, both with respect to foreign
politics and especially Irish Education.</p>

<h3>Monday, May 14th, 1832</h3>

<p>Nothing more was known yesterday,
but everybody was congregated at the clubs, asking, discussing,
and wondering. There was a great meeting at Apsley
House, when it was supposed everything was settled. The
Household went yesterday to St. James&rsquo;s to resign their sticks
and badges; amongst the rest Lord Foley. The King was
very civil to him; made him sit down and said, &lsquo;Lord Foley,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
you are a young man.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir, I am afraid I cannot flatter
myself that I have any right to that appellation.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, yes;
you are a young man&mdash;at all events in comparison with me&mdash;and
you will probably come into office again; but I am an old
man, and I am afraid I shall not have the pleasure of seeing
you there.&rsquo; It is supposed that this <i>coup</i> has been preparing
for some time. All the Royal Family, bastards and all, have
been incessantly <i>at</i> the King, and he has probably had more
difficulty in the long run in resisting the constant importunity
of his <i>entourage</i>, and of his womankind particularly, than
the dictates of his Ministers; and between this gradual but
powerful impression, and his real opinion and fears, he was
not sorry to seize the first good opportunity of shaking off
the Whigs. When Lord Anglesey went to take leave of him
at Windsor he was struck with the change in his sentiments,
and told Lady Anglesey so, who repeated it to my brother.</p>

<p>It is gratifying to find that those with whom I used to
dispute, and who would hear of nothing but rejecting the
second reading, now admit that my view was the correct one,
and Vesey Fitzgerald, with whom I had more than one discussion,
complimented me very handsomely upon the justification
of my view of the question which the event had
afforded. The High Tories, of course, will never admit that
they could have been wrong, and have no other resource but
to insist boldly that the King never would have made Peers
at all.<a name="FNA_18_05" id="FNA_18_05"></a><a href="#FN_18_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

[Everyone knows how short-lived were the expectations caused by the
temporary resignation of Lord Grey&rsquo;s Government. It will be seen in the
following pages how soon the vision passed away; but the foregoing passages
are retained precisely because they contain a vivid and faithful picture
of the state of opinion at the moment.]</p></div>

<h3>London, May 17th, 1832</h3>

<p>The events of the last few days have
passed with a rapidity which hardly left time to think upon
them&mdash;such sudden changes and transitions from rage to
triumph on one side, and from foolish exultation to mortification
and despair on the other. The first impression was that
the Duke of Wellington would succeed in forming a Government,
with or without Peel. The first thing he did was to try
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">WELLINGTON&rsquo;S EFFORTS TO FORM A MINISTRY.</span>
and prevail upon Peel to be Prime Minister, but he was inexorable.
He then turned to
Baring,<a name="FNA_18_06" id="FNA_18_06"></a><a href="#FN_18_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
who, after much hesitation,
agreed to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. The work went
on, but with difficulty, for neither Peel, Goulburn, nor Croker
would take office. They then tried the Speaker, who was
mightily tempted to become Secretary of State, but still
doubting and fearing, and requiring time to make up his
mind. At an interview with the Duke and Lyndhurst at
Apsley House he declared his sentiments on the existing
state of affairs in a speech of three hours, to the unutterable
disgust of Lyndhurst, who returned home, flung himself into
a chair, and said that &lsquo;he could not endure to have anything
to do with such a <i>damned tiresome old bitch</i>.&rsquo; After these
three hours of oratory Manners Sutton desired to have till
the next morning (Monday) to make up his mind, which he
again begged might be extended till the evening. On that
evening (Monday) ensued the memorable night in the House
of Commons, which everybody agrees was such a scene of
violence and excitement as never had been exhibited within
those walls. Tavistock told me he had never heard anything at
all like it, and to his dying day should not forget it. The House
was crammed to suffocation; every violent sentiment and vituperative
expression was received with shouts of approbation,
yet the violent speakers were listened to with the greatest
attention.<a name="FNA_18_07" id="FNA_18_07"></a><a href="#FN_18_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Tom Duncombe made one of his blustering Radical
harangues, full of every sort of impertinence, which was received
with immense applause, but which contrasted with an
admirable speech, full of dignity, but also of sarcasm and
severity, from John Russell&mdash;the best he ever made. The conduct
of the Duke of Wellington in taking office <i>to carry the Bill</i>,
which was not denied, but which his friends feebly attempted
to justify, was assailed with the most merciless severity, and
(what made the greatest impression) was condemned (though
in more measured terms) by moderate men and Tories, such
as Inglis and Davies Gilbert. Baring, who spoke four times,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
at last proposed that there should be a compromise, and that
the ex-Ministers should resume their seats and carry the
Bill. This extraordinary proposition was drawn from him
by the state of the House, and the impossibility he at once
saw of forming a new Government, and without any previous
concert with the Duke, who, however, entirely approved of
what he said. After the debate Baring and Sutton went to
Apsley House, and related to the Duke what had taken
place, the former saying he would face a thousand devils
rather than such a House of Commons. From that moment
the whole thing was at an end, and the next morning (Tuesday)
the Duke repaired to the King, and told him that he
could not form an Administration. This communication, for
which the debate of the previous night had prepared everybody,
was speedily known, and the joy and triumph of the
Whigs were complete.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_18_06" id="FN_18_06"></a><a href="#FNA_18_06"><span class="label">[6]</span></a>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_18_07" id="FN_18_07"></a><a href="#FNA_18_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[The debate arose on a petition of the City of London, praying that the
House would refuse supplies until the Reform Bill had become law.]</p></div>

<p>The King desired the Duke and Lyndhurst (for they went
together) to advise him what he should do. They advised
him to write to Lord Grey (which he did), informing him that
the Duke had given up the commission to form a Government,
that he had heard of what had fallen from Mr. Baring
in the House of Commons the night before on the subject of
a compromise, and that he wished Lord Grey to return and
resume the Government upon that principle. Lord Grey
sent an answer full of the usual expressions of zeal and respect,
but saying that he could give no answer until he had
consulted his colleagues. He assembled his Cabinet, and at
five o&rsquo;clock the answer was
sent.<a name="FNA_18_08" id="FNA_18_08"></a><a href="#FN_18_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_18_08" id="FN_18_08"></a><a href="#FNA_18_08"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
[These communications have been published in the &lsquo;Correspondence of
Earl Grey with William IV.,&rsquo; vol. ii. pp. 406-411.]</p></div>

<p>Yesterday morning Lord Grey saw the King; but up to
last night nothing was finally settled, everything turning
upon the terms to be exacted, some of the violent of the
party desiring they should avail themselves of this opportunity
to make Peers, both to show their power and increase
their strength; the more moderate, including Lord Grey
himself and many of the old Peer-makers, were for sparing
the King&rsquo;s feelings and using their victory with moderation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">TRIUMPH OF THE WHIGS.</span>
all, however, agreeing that the only condition on which they
could return was the certainty of carrying the Reform
Bill unaltered, either by a creation of Peers or by the
secession of its opponents. Up to the present moment
the matter stands thus: the King at the mercy of the Whigs,
just as averse as ever to make Peers, the violent wishing to
press him, the moderate wishing to spare him, all parties
railing at each other, the Tories broken and discomfited, and
meditating no further resistance to the Reform Bill. The
Duke is to make his <i>exposé</i> to-night.</p>

<p>Peel, who has kept himself out of the scrape, is strongly
suspected of being anything but sorry for the dilemma into
which the Duke has got himself, and they think that he
secretly encouraged him to persevere, with promises of present
support and future co-operation, with a shrewd anticipation
of the fate that awaited him. I am by no means indisposed
to give credit to this, for I well remember the wrath of
Peel when the Duke&rsquo;s Government was broken up in 1830, and
the various instances of secret dislike and want of real cordiality
which have peeped from under a decent appearance of
union and friendship. Nothing can be more certain than that
he is in high spirits in the midst of it all, and talks with great
complacency of its being very well as it is, and that the salvation
of character is everything; and this from him, who
fancies he has saved his own, and addressed to those who
have forfeited theirs, is amusing.</p>

<p>The joy of the King at what he thought was to be his
deliverance from the Whigs was unbounded. He lost no
time in putting the Duke of Wellington in possession of
everything that had taken place between him and them upon
the subject of Reform, and with regard to the creation of
Peers, admitting that he had consented, but saying he had
been subjected to every species of persecution. His ignorance,
weakness, and levity put him in a miserable light, and prove
him to be one of the silliest old gentlemen in his dominions;
but I believe he is mad, for yesterday he gave a great dinner
to the Jockey Club, at which (notwithstanding his cares) he
seemed in excellent spirits; and after dinner he made a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
number of speeches, so ridiculous and nonsensical, beyond
all belief but to those who heard them, rambling from one
subject to another, repeating the same thing over and over
again, and altogether such a mass of confusion, trash, and
imbecility as made one laugh and blush at the same time.</p>

<p>As soon as the Duke had agreed to try and form a
Government he applied to the Tories, who nearly all agreed
to support him, and were prepared to go to all lengths, even
to that of swallowing the whole Bill if necessary; the Duke
of Newcastle particularly would do anything. These were
the men who were so squeamish that they could not be
brought to support amendments even, unless they were permitted
to turn the schedules upside-down, straining at gnats
out of office and swallowing camels in. It is remarkable
that after the sacrifice Wharncliffe made to re-ingratiate
himself with the Tories, incurring the detestation and abuse
of the Whigs, and their reproach of bad faith, the former
have utterly neglected him, taking no notice of him whatever
during the whole of their proceedings from the moment of
the division, leaving him in ignorance of their plans and
intentions, never inviting him to any of their meetings, and
although a communication was made by Lyndhurst to
Harrowby (they wanted Harrowby to be Prime Minister),
the latter was not at liberty to impart it to Wharncliffe. It
is not possible to be more deeply mortified than he is at the
treatment he has experienced from these allies after having
so committed himself. From the account of the King&rsquo;s
levity throughout these proceedings, I strongly suspect that
(if he lives) he will go mad. While the Duke and Lyndhurst
were with him, at one of the most critical moments (I forget
now at which) he said, &lsquo;I have been thinking that something
is wanting with regard to Hanover. Duke, you are now my
Minister, and I beg you will think of this; I should like to
have a slice of Belgium, which would be a convenient addition
to Hanover. Pray remember this,&rsquo; and then resumed the
subject they were upon.</p>

<h3>May 19th, 1832</h3>

<p>The night before last the Duke made his
statement. It was extremely clear, but very bald, and left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING&rsquo;S LETTER TO THE PEERS.</span>
his case just where it was, as he did not say anything that
everybody did not know before. His friends, however,
extolled it as a masterpiece of eloquence and a complete
vindication of himself. The Tory Lords who spoke after him
bedaubed him with praise, and vied with each other in
expressions of admiration. These were Carnarvon, Winchelsea,
and Haddington. There was not one word from
the Duke (nor from the others) indicative of an intention to
secede, which was what the Government expected. His
speech contained a sort of covert attack upon Peel; in fact,
he could not defend himself without attacking Peel, for if the
one was in the right in taking office the other must have been
in the wrong in refusing to join him. There was nothing,
however, which was meant as a reproach, though out of the
House the Duke&rsquo;s friends do not conceal their anger that
Peel would not embark with him in his desperate enterprise.</p>

<p>Lyndhurst was exceedingly able, highly excited, very
eloquent, and contrived to make his case a good one. It was
a fine display and very short. Carnarvon and Mansfield
were outrageously violent, but both in their way clever, and
parts of the speech of the latter were eloquent. Lord Grey was
excellent, short, very temperate and judicious, exactly what
was requisite and nothing more. Nobody else spoke on his
side, except Mulgrave at the end.</p>

<p>The debate, however interesting, left the whole matter in
uncertainty; and the next day the old question began again.
What was to be done&mdash;Peers or no Peers? A Cabinet sat
nearly all day, and Lord Grey went once or twice to the
King. He, poor man, was at his wits&rsquo; end, and tried an
experiment (not a very constitutional one) of his own by
writing to a number of Peers, entreating them to withdraw
their opposition to the Bill. These letters were written (I
think) before the debate. On Thursday nothing was settled,
and at another meeting of the Cabinet a minute was drawn up
agreeing to offer again the same advice to the King. Before
this was acted upon Richmond, who had been absent, arrived,
and he prevailed upon his colleagues to cancel it. In the
meantime the Duke of Wellington, Lyndhurst, and other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Peers had given the desired assurances to the King, which
he communicated to Lord Grey. These were accepted as
sufficient securities, and declarations made accordingly in
both Houses of Parliament. If the Ministers had again gone
to the King with this advice, it is impossible to say how it
would have ended, for he had already been obstinate, and
might have continued so on this point, and he told Lord
Verulam that he thought it would be contrary to his coronation
oath to make Peers. Our princes have strange notions
of the obligations imposed by their coronation oath.</p>

<p>On Thursday in the House of Commons Peel made his
statement, in which, with great civility and many expressions
of esteem and admiration of the Duke, he pronounced as
bitter a censure of his conduct, while apparently confining
himself to the defence of his own, as it was possible to do,
and as such it was taken. I have not the least doubt that he
did it <i>con amore</i>, and that he is doubly rejoiced to be out of
the scrape himself and to leave others in it.</p>

<h3>May 31st, 1832</h3>

<p>Since I came back from Newmarket there has
not been much to write about. A calm has succeeded the
storm. Last night Schedules A and B were galloped
through the Committee, and they finished the business. On
Thursday next the Bill will probably be read a third time.
In the House of Lords some dozen Tories and Waverers have
continued to keep up a little skirmish, and a good deal of
violent language has been bandied about, in which the Whigs,
being the winners, have shown the best temper. In society
the excitement has ceased, but the bitterness remains. The
Tories are, however, so utterly defeated, and the victory of
their opponents is so complete, that the latter can afford to
be moderate and decorous in their tone and manner; and the
former are exceedingly sulky, cockering up each other with
much self-gratulation and praise, but aware that in the
opinion of the mass of mankind they are covered with odium,
ridicule, and disgrace. Peel and the Duke are ostensibly
great friends, and the ridiculous farce is still kept up of
each admiring what he would not do himself, but what the
other did.</p>

<h3>June 1st, 1832</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">FAVOURITES OF LOUIS XVIII.</span>
Met the Duke of Wellington at dinner yesterday,
and afterwards had a long talk with him, not on
politics. I never see and converse with him without reproaching
myself for the sort of hostility I feel and express
towards his political conduct, for there are a simplicity, a
gaiety, and natural urbanity and good-humour in him, which
are remarkably captivating in so great a man. We talked
of Dumont&rsquo;s book and Louis XVIII.&rsquo;s &lsquo;Memoirs.&rsquo; I said I
thought the &lsquo;Memoirs&rsquo; were not genuine. He said he was
sure they were, that they bore the strongest internal evidence
of being so, particularly in their accuracy as to dates, that he
was the best chronologist in the world, and that he knew the
day of the week of every event of importance. He once
asked the Duke when he was born, and when he told him the
day of the month and year, he at once said it was on a Tuesday;
that he (the Duke) had remembered that throughout the book
the day of the week was always mentioned, and many of the
anecdotes he had himself heard the King tell. He then
talked of him, and I was surprised to hear him say that
Charles X. was a cleverer man, as far as knowledge of the
world went, though Louis XVIII. was much better informed&mdash;a
most curious remark, considering the history and end of
each. [Nothing could be more mistaken and untrue than
this opinion.] That Louis XVIII. was always governed,
and a favourite indispensable to him. At the Congress of
Vienna the Duke was deputed to speak to M. de Blacas, his
then favourite, and tell him that his unpopularity was so
great in France that it was desirable he should not return
there. Blacas replied, &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know the King; he must
have a favourite, and he had better have me than another.
I shall go; he will have another, and you should take pains
to put a <i>gentleman</i> in that situation, for he is capable of
taking the first person that finds access to him and the
opportunity of pleasing him.&rsquo; He added that he should not
wonder if he took Fouché. He did not take Fouché, who was
not aware of the part he might have played, but he took De
Cazes, who governed him entirely. This continued till the
Royal Family determined to get rid of him, and by threatening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
to make an <i>esclandre</i> and leave the château they at last
succeeded, and De Cazes was sent as Ambassador to London.
Then the King wrote to him constantly, sending him verses
and literary scraps. The place remained vacant till accident
threw Madame du Cayla in his
way.<a name="FNA_18_09" id="FNA_18_09"></a><a href="#FN_18_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
She was the daughter
of Talon, who had been concerned in the affair of the Marquis
de Favras, and she sent to the King to say she had some papers
of her father&rsquo;s relating to that affair, which she should like
to give into his own hands. He saw her and was pleased
with her. The Royal Family encouraged this new taste, in
order to get rid entirely of De Cazes, and even the Duchesse
d&rsquo;Angoulême promoted her success. It was the same thing
to him to have a woman as a man, and there was no sexual
question in the matter, as what he wanted was merely some
one to whom he could tell everything, consult with on all
occasions, and with whom he could bandy literary trifles.
Madame du Cayla, who was clever, was speedily installed, and
he directly gave up De Cazes. He told the Duke that he
was <i>brouillé</i> with De Cazes, who had behaved very ill to him,
but he had nothing specific to allege against him, except
that his manner to him was not what it ought to have been.
The Ministers paid assiduous court to Madame du Cayla,
imparted everything to her, and got her to say what they
wanted said to the King; she acted all the part of a mistress,
except the essential, of which there never was any question.
She got great sums of money from him and very valuable
presents.</p>

<h3>June 18th, 1832</h3>

<p>Breakfasted on Thursday with Rogers, and
yesterday at the Athenæum with Henry Taylor, and met Mr.
Charles Austin, a lawyer, clever man, and Radical. The Bills
are jogging on and there is a comparative calm. The Whigs
swear that the Reformed Parliament will be the most aristocratic
we have ever seen, and Ellice told me that they cannot
hear of a single improper person likely to be elected for any
of the new places. [Their choice did not correspond with
this statement of their disposition.] The metropolitan districts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF WILLIAM IV.</span>
want rank and talent. The Government and their
people have now found out what a fool the King is, and it is
very amusing to hear them on the subject. Formerly, when
they thought they had him fast, he was very honest and
rather wise; now they find him rather shuffling and exceedingly
silly. When Normanby went to take leave of him on
going to Jamaica, he pronounced a harangue in favour of
the slave trade, of which he has always been a great admirer,
and expressed sentiments for which his subjects would
tear him to pieces if they heard them. It is one of the great
evils of the recent convulsion that the King&rsquo;s imbecility has
been exposed to the world, and in his person the regal
authority has fallen into contempt; his own personal unpopularity
is not of much consequence as long as it does not
degrade his office; that of George IV. never did, so little so
that he could always as King cancel the bad impressions
which he made in his individual capacity, and he frequently
did so. Walter Scott is arrived here, dying. A great
mortality among great men; Goethe, Périer, Champollion,
Cuvier, Scott, Grant, Mackintosh, all died within a few weeks
of each other.</p>

<h3>June 25th, 1832</h3>

<p>At Fern Hill all last week; a great party,
nothing but racing and gambling; then to Shepperton, and
to town on Saturday. The event of the races was the King&rsquo;s
having his head knocked with a stone. It made very little
sensation on the spot, for he was not hurt, and the fellow
was a miserable-looking ragamuffin. It, however, produced
a great burst of loyalty in both Houses, and their Majesties
were loudly cheered at Ascot. The Duke of Wellington, who
had been the day before mobbed in London, also reaped a
little harvest of returning popularity from the assault, and
so far the outrages have done rather good than harm.</p>

<h3>July 12th, 1832</h3>

<p>The suttee case was decided at the Privy
Council on Saturday last, and was not uninteresting. The
Chancellor, Lord President, Graham, John Russell and Grant,
Sir Edward East, the Master of Rolls, Vice-Chancellor, Lord
Amherst, and Lord Wellesley were present (the latter not the
last day). Lushington was for the appeal, and Home and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
Starkie against. The former made two very able and ingenious
speeches; when the counsel withdrew the Lords gave their
opinions <i>seriatim</i>. Leach made a very short and very neat
speech, condemning the
order<a name="FNA_18_10" id="FNA_18_10"></a><a href="#FN_18_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
of the Governor-General, but
admitting the danger of rescinding it, and recommending,
therefore, that the execution of it should be suspended. Sir
Edward East, in a long, diffusive harangue, likewise condemned
the order, but was against suspension; Sir James
Graham was against the order, but against suspension; Lord
Amherst the same. The rest approved of the order altogether.
John Russell gave his opinion very well. The Chancellor was
prolix and confused; he hit upon a bit of metaphysics in one
of the cases on which he took pleasure in dilating. The result
was that the petition was dismissed.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_18_10" id="FN_18_10"></a><a href="#FNA_18_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a>
The order was a decree of the Governor-General of India abolishing
the practice of suttee, against which certain Hindoos appealed to the
King in Council. Another party, however, were in favour of the order,
and the Rajah Rammohun Roy is acting in this country as their agent.</p></div>

<p>I know nothing of politics for some time past. The
Reform fever having subsided, people are principally occupied
with speculations on the next elections. At present there
is every appearance of the return of a House of Commons
very favourable to the present Government, but the Tory
party keeps together in the House of Lords, and they are
animated with vague hopes of being able to turn out the
Ministry, more from a spirit of hatred and revenge than
from any clear view of the practicability of their carrying
on the Government. I conceive, however, that as soon as
Parliament is up there will be a creation of Peers. In the
House of Commons the Irish Tithe question has been the
great subject of interest and discussion. O&rsquo;Connell and the
Irish members debate and adjourn just as they please, and
Althorp is obliged to give way to them. When Stanley
moved for leave to bring in his Bill, he detailed his plan in
a speech of two hours. They thought fit to oppose this,
which is quite unusual, and O&rsquo;Connell did not arrive till
after Stanley had sat down. Not having heard his speech
he could not answer him, and he therefore moved the adjournment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">O&rsquo;CONNELL&rsquo;S DREAD OF CHOLERA.</span>
Upon a former occasion, during the Reform
Bill, when the Tories moved an adjournment after many
hours&rsquo; debate, the Government opposed it, and voted on
through the night till seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning; now
the Tories were ready to support Government against the
Irish members, but they would not treat the Radicals as
they did the Tories, and then on a subsequent occasion they
submitted to have the debate adjourned.</p>

<p>O&rsquo;Connell is supposed to be horridly afraid of the cholera.
He has dodged about between London and Dublin, as the
disease appeared first at one and then the other place, and
now that it is everywhere he shirks the House of Commons
from fear of the heat and the atmosphere. The cholera is
here, and diffuses a certain degree of alarm. Some servants
of people well known have died, and that frightens all other
servants out of their wits, and they frighten their masters;
the death of any one person they are acquainted with terrifies
people much more than that of twenty of whom they knew
nothing. As long as they read daily returns of a parcel of
deaths here and there of A, B, and C they do not mind,
but when they hear that Lady such a one&rsquo;s nurse or Sir
somebody&rsquo;s footman is dead, they fancy they see the disease
actually at their own door.</p>

<h3>July 15th, 1832</h3>

<p>I had a good deal of conversation yesterday
with Lord Duncannon and Lord John Russell about Ireland.
The debate the night before lasted till four o&rsquo;clock. O&rsquo;Connell
made a furious speech, and Dawson the other evening another,
talking of resistance and of his readiness to join in it. This
drew up Peel, who had spoken before, and who, when attacked
with cries of &lsquo;Spoke!&rsquo; said, &lsquo;Yes, I have spoken, but I will
say that no party considerations shall prevent my supporting
Government in this measure, and giving them my cordial
support.&rsquo; He was furious with Dawson, and got up in
order to throw him over, though he did not address himself
to him, or to anything he had said expressly. John Russell
spoke out what ought to have been said long ago, that the
Church could not stand, but that the present clergyman
must be paid. Both he and Duncannon are aware of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
false position in which the Government is placed, pretending
to legislate with a knowledge that their laws cannot be
enforced, and the latter said that, whatever might be done,
the Irish would take nothing at the hands of Stanley. It
is unfortunate that his attachment to the Church makes
him the unfittest man in the country to manage Irish affairs,
and he has contrived to make himself so personally unpopular
that with the best intentions he could not give satisfaction.
Under these circumstances his remaining there is impossible,
but what is to be done with him? He is of such importance
in the House of Commons that they cannot part with him.
I asked John Russell why they did not send Hobhouse to
Ireland and make Stanley Secretary of War. He said would
he consent to exchange? that he was tired of office, and
would be glad to be out. I said I could not suppose in such
an emergency that he would allow any personal considerations
to influence him, and that he would consent to whatever
arrangement would be most beneficial to the Government
and conducive to the settlement of Irish affairs. The truth
is (as I told him) that they are, with respect to Ireland, in
the situation of a man who has got an old house in which
he can no longer live, not tenable; various architects propose
this and that alteration, to build a room here and pull down
one there, but at last they find that all these alterations will
only serve to make the house habitable a little while longer,
that the dry rot is in it, and that they had better begin, as
they will be obliged to end, by pulling it down and building
up a new one. He owned this was true, but said that here
another difficulty presented itself with regard to Stanley&mdash;whether
he would, as a leading member of the Cabinet, consent
to any measures which might go so much further than
he would be disposed to do. I said that I could not imagine
(whatever might be his predilections) that his mind was not
awakened to the necessity of giving way to the state of things,
and that he might consent to measures which he felt he was
not a fit person to introduce and recommend. He assented
to this. He then talked of the views of the Protestants, of
the Lefroys, &amp;c., that they began to admit the necessity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">IRISH TITHES.</span>
a change, but by no means would consent to the alienation
of Church property from Protestant uses, that they were
willing where there was a large parish consisting entirely
of Catholics that the tithes should be taken from the rector
of such parish and given to one who had a large Protestant
flock&mdash;an arrangement which would disgust the Catholics as
much as or more than any other, and be considered a perfect
mockery. The fact is we may shift and change and wriggle
about as much as we will, we may examine and report and
make laws, but tithe, the tithe system is at an end. The
people will not pay them, and there are no means of compelling
them. The march of events is just as certain as that
of the seasons. The question which is said to be beset with
difficulties is in fact very easy&mdash;that is, its difficulties arise
from conflicting interests and passions, and not from the
uncertainty of its operation and end. Those conflicting
passions are certainly very great and very embarrassing,
and it is no easy matter to deal with them, but it seems to
me that the wisest policy is to keep our eyes steadfastly fixed
on the end, and, admitting the inevitable conclusion, labour
to bring it about with the smallest amount of individual loss,
the greatest general benefit, and the best chance of permanence
and stability. By casting lingering looks at the old
system, and endeavouring to save something here and there,
by allowing the Church to remain in the rags and tatters
of its old supremacy, we shall foster those hostile feelings
which it is essential to put down for ever, and leave the
seeds of grievance and hatred to spring up in a future harvest
of agitation and confusion.</p>

<h3>July 25th, 1832</h3>

<p>Nothing of moment has occurred lately; the
dread of cholera absorbs everybody. Mrs. Smith, young and
beautiful, was dressed to go to church on Sunday morning,
when she was seized with the disorder, never had a chance of
rallying, and died at eleven at night. This event, shocking
enough in itself from its suddenness and the youth and beauty
of the person, has created a terrible alarm; many people have
taken flight, and others are suspended between their hopes of
safety in country air and their dread of being removed from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
metropolitan aid. The disease spreads gradually in all directions
in town and country, but without appearing like an
epidemic; it is scattered and uncertain; it brings to light
horrible distress. We, who live on the smooth and plausible
surface, know little of the frightful appearance of the bowels
of society.</p>

<p>Don Pedro has never been heard of since he landed, and
nobody seems much to care whether he or Miguel succeed.
The Tories are for the latter and the Whigs for the former.
In a fourth debate on the Russian Dutch Loan Ministers
got a good finale, a large division, and a brilliant speech
from Stanley, totally unprepared and prodigiously successful.
Nothing could be worse in point of tactics than renewing this
contest, neither party having, in fact, a good case. Parliament
is going to separate soon, and the cholera will accelerate
the prorogation; not a step has been made towards an approximation
between the rival parties, who appear to be
animated against each other with unabated virulence. The
moderate Tories talk of their desire to see the Government
discard their Radical friends, but the great body give them no
encouragement to do so by evincing any diminished hostility
to them as a party. Opinions are so different as to the
probable composition of the next Parliament, that it is
difficult to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion about it. The
Tories evidently expect that they shall reappear in very
formidable strength, though in particular places the Tory
party is entirely crushed; the sooner it is so altogether the
better, for no good can be expected from it, and it would be
far better to erect a Conservative party upon a new and
broader basis than to try and bolster up this worn-out,
prejudiced, obstinate faction. But the times are difficult
and men are wanting; the middle classes are pressing on,
and there are men enough there of fortune, energy, activity,
zeal, and ambition&mdash;no Cannings perhaps or Broughams, but
a host of fellows of the calibre of the actors in the old French
Constituent Assembly.</p>

<h3>July 29th, 1832</h3>

<p>There has been a great breeze between the
Chancellor and Sugden, abusing and retorting upon each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">QUARREL BETWEEN BROUGHAM AND SUGDEN.</span>
other from their respective Houses of Parliament. As all
personal matters excite greater interest than any others, so
has this. Scott, Lord Eldon&rsquo;s son, died, and his places became
vacant. Brougham had recommended their abolition
long ago in his evidence before the House of Commons, and
both publicly and privately. Some days ago Sugden gave
notice to Horne (Solicitor-General) that he meant to put a
question to him in the House of Commons as to whether
these appointments were to be filled up or not, but before he
did so (at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning) the writ was moved
for James Brougham, who had been put by the Chancellor in
Scott&rsquo;s place. Accordingly the next day Sugden attacked
the appointment in the House of Commons, and though he
was by way of only asking a question, he in fact made a long
vituperative speech. Nobody was there to reply. Althorp
said he knew nothing of the matter, and various speeches
were made, all expressive of a desire that the appointment
should only be temporary. Horne (it seems) had never told
the Chancellor what Sugden said, and Denman, who had no
authority from him, did not dare get up and say that it was
not to be permanent. Later in the day, having received instructions
from the Chancellor, he did get up and say so.
The next day Brougham introduced the subject in the
House of Lords, and attacked Sugden with all the sarcasm
and contumely which he could heap upon him, comparing
him to &lsquo;a crawling reptile,&rsquo; &amp;c. Not one of his Tory friends
said a word, and, what is curious, the Duke of Wellington
praised Brougham for his disinterestedness, and old Eldon
defended the place. The following day (Friday) Sugden
again brought the matter before the House of Commons,
complained bitterly of the Chancellor&rsquo;s speech, was called to
order by Stanley, when the Speaker interfered, and, dexterously
turning Sugden&rsquo;s attack upon the newspaper report,
enabled him to go on. A violent discussion followed, rather
awkward for the Chancellor, whose friends endeavoured to
soften the thing down by denying the accuracy of the report.
After much acrimonious debate the matter ended. Yesterday
the &lsquo;Times,&rsquo; throwing over Brougham and Sugden, asserted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the accuracy of its own reporter, and declared that whether
the Chancellor was right or wrong to have uttered them, the
words were spoken by him exactly as they had been reported.
Both parties are furious, but on the whole the Chancellor
seems at present to have the worst of it, for it is worse for a
man in his station to be in the wrong, and more indecent to
be scurrilous, than for an individual who is nothing. Sugden
now declares he will bring on a motion he has long meditated
on the subject of the Court of Chancery, in which he will
exhibit to the world the whole conduct of Brougham since he
has held the Great Seal, his early haste and precipitation, his
recent carelessness and delay, his ignorance, inattention, and
incompetence for the office he holds. In this he expects to
be supported by Wetherell, Knight, and Pemberton, three of
the most eminent Chancery lawyers, while Brougham has
nobody but Horne (of the profession) to defend him. If this
should occur he may thank himself, for he would put Horne
there.</p>

<p>Sir Charles Bagot called on me yesterday; told me that
he thought the Belgian question was at last on the point of
being settled, that the King of Holland had made &lsquo;the great
concession,&rsquo; and that the rest must soon follow, that he had
never passed two such years amidst such difficulties, the King
so obstinate. His view was that by holding out and maintaining
a large army events would produce war, and that he
would be able to sell himself to some one of the contending
parties, getting back Belgium as the price of his aid, that
he now only gave in because not a hope was left, that the
difficulties were so great that it was not the fault of this
Government that matters were not settled before. I asked
him how the Dutch had contrived to make such an exertion.
He said it was very creditable to them, but that they were
very rich and very frugal, and had lugged out their hoards.
They had saddled themselves with a debt the interest of which
amounts to about 700,000&#8467;. a year&mdash;a good deal for two
millions of people.</p>

<h3>August 1st, 1832</h3>

<p>Here is an anecdote exhibiting the character
of Brougham, hot, passionate, and precipitate. He is preparing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BROUGHAM&rsquo;S RESENTMENT.</span>
his Bill for the amendment of the Court of Chancery,
by which the patronage is to be done away with. Compensation
was to be given to the present interests, but upon this
recent affair between Sugden and him, to revenge himself
upon men who are all or mostly of Sugden&rsquo;s party, he
ordered the compensation clauses to be struck out. Sefton
(who is a sort of Sancho to him) came up to dinner quite
elated at having heard the order given. &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;you had heard a man treated as I did in the Chancellor&rsquo;s
room. He came in to ask him about the Bill he was drawing
up. &ldquo;I suppose the compensation clauses are to be put in?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Compensation?&rdquo; said Brougham. &ldquo;No, by God; no compensation.
Leave them out, if you please. They chose to
attack me, and they shall have enough of it.&rdquo;&rsquo; And what will
be the end of all this&mdash;that the Chancellor shows his spite
and commits himself, shows that he is influenced in legislation
by personal feelings, and incurs the suspicion that because
he cannot get a compensation for his brother he is resolved
nobody else shall have any? Althorp&rsquo;s speech about the
pensions on Monday set at rest the question of compensation,
and if these offices are abolished the Chancellor cannot prevent
their getting it. In the House of Lords the eternal
Russian Dutch Loan came on again. The Duke made a
speech and Wynford made a speech, and they were opposed
to each other; the Duke hit the right nail on the head, and
took that course which he frequently does, and which is such
a redeeming quality in his political character&mdash;addressed
himself to the <i>question itself</i>, to the real merits of it, without
making it a mere vehicle for annoying the Government.
Aberdeen sneered, but when the Duke throws over his people
they can do nothing.</p>

<h3>August 8th, 1832</h3>

<p>Pedro&rsquo;s expedition, which always has
hobbled along, and never exhibited any of that dash which
is essential to the success of such efforts, may be considered
hopeless; Palmella arrived here a day or two ago, very low,
and the Regency scrip has fallen four per cent. Nobody
joins them, and it seems pretty clear that, one <i>coquin</i> for
another, the Portuguese think they may as well have Miguel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
The Dutch affair is not yet settled, but on the point of it;
for the fiftieth time a &lsquo;little hitch&rsquo; has again arisen. Last
night, in the House of Lords, the Chancellor, in one of his
most bungling ways, made what he meant to be a sort of
<i>amende</i> to Sugden, making the matter rather worse than it
was before, at least for his own credit, for he said that &lsquo;he
had never intended to give pain, which he of all things
abhorred,&rsquo; and that he had not been at all in a passion&mdash;both
false, and the latter being in fact his only excuse. I sat next
to Melbourne at dinner, who concurred in the judgment of
the world on the whole transaction, and said, &lsquo;The real truth
is, he was in a great rage, for he had forgotten all his own
evidence and his own speeches, and he meant to have kept
the place.&rsquo; This evidence from his own colleague and friend
is conclusive, and will be a nice morsel for the future biographer
of Brougham.</p>

<p>I dined at Holland House yesterday; a good many people,
and the Chancellor came in after dinner, looking like an old
clothes man and dirty as the ground. We had a true Holland
House dinner, two more people arriving (Melbourne and Tom
Duncombe) than there was room for, so that Lady Holland
had the pleasure of a couple of general squeezes, and of
seeing our arms prettily pinioned. Lord Holland sits at
table, but does not dine. He proposed to retire (not from the
room), but was not allowed, for that would have given us all
space and ease. Lord Holland told some stories of Johnson
and Garrick which he had heard from Kemble. Johnson
loved to bully Garrick, from a recollection of Garrick&rsquo;s former
impertinence. When Garrick was in the zenith of his popularity,
and grown rich, and lived with the great, and while
Johnson was yet obscure, the Doctor used to drink tea with
him, and he would say, &lsquo;Davy, I do not envy you your
money nor your fine acquaintance, but I envy you your
power of drinking such tea as this.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Garrick, &lsquo;it
is very good tea, but it is not my best, nor that which I give
to my Lord this and Sir somebody t&rsquo;other.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Johnson liked Fox because he defended his pension, and
said it was only to blame in not being large enough.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF MACAULAY.</span>
&lsquo;Fox,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;is a liberal man; he would always be &ldquo;aut
Cæsar aut nullus;&rdquo; whenever I have seen him he has been
<i>nullus</i>.&rsquo; Lord Holland said Fox made it a rule never to talk
in Johnson&rsquo;s presence, because he knew all his conversations
were recorded for publication, and he did not choose to figure
in them.</p>

<h3>August 12th, 1832</h3>

<p>The House of Commons has finished (or
nearly) its business. Althorp ended with a blunder. He
brought in a Bill to extend the time for payment of rates
and for voters under the new Bill, and because it was opposed
he abandoned it suddenly; his friends are disgusted. Robarts
told me that the Bank Committee had executed their laborious
duties in a spirit of great cordiality, and with a general
disposition to lay aside all political differences and concur in
accomplishing the best results; a good thing, for it is in such
transactions as these, which afford an opportunity for laying
aside the bitterness of party and the rancorous feelings
which animate men against each other, that the only chance
can be found of a future amalgamation of public men. He
told me that the evidence all went to prove that little
improvement could be made in the management of the
Bank.</p>

<p>Dined yesterday at Holland House; the Chancellor, Lord
Grey, Luttrell, Palmerston, and Macaulay. The Chancellor
was sleepy and would not talk; he uttered nothing but
yawns and grunts. Macaulay and Allen disputed history,
particularly the character of the Emperor Frederick II., and
Allen declared himself a Guelph and Macaulay a Ghibelline.
Macaulay is a most extraordinary man, and his astonishing
knowledge is every moment exhibited, but (as far as I have yet
seen of him, which is not sufficient to judge) he is not <i>agreeable</i>.
His propositions and his allusions are rather too abrupt;
he starts topics not altogether naturally; then he has none
of the graces of conversation, none of that exquisite tact and
refinement which are the result of a felicitous intuition or a
long acquaintance with good society, or more probably a
mixture of both. The mighty mass of his knowledge is not
animated by that subtle spirit of taste and discretion which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
alone can give it the qualities of lightness and elasticity, and
without which, though he may have the power of instructing
and astonishing, he never will attain that of delighting
and captivating his hearers. The dinner was agreeable, and
enlivened by a squabble between Lady Holland and Allen,
at which we were all ready to die of laughing. He jeered
at something she said as brutal, and chuckled at his own
wit.</p>

<h3>Shepperton, August 31st, 1832</h3>

<p>I came here last Sunday to
see my father, who (my mother wrote me word) had been
unwell for a day or two. I got here at four o&rsquo;clock (having
called on Madame de Lieven at Richmond on the way),
and when I arrived I found my father at the point of
death. He was attacked as he had often been before; medicines
afforded him no relief, and nothing would stay on his
stomach. On Saturday violent spasms came on, which
occasioned him dreadful pain; they continued intermittingly
till Sunday afternoon, when as they took him out of bed to
put him in a warm bath, he fainted. From this state of insensibility
he never recovered, and at half-past twelve o&rsquo;clock
he expired. My brothers were both here. I sent an express
for my sister, who was at Malvern, and she arrived on Tuesday
morning. Dr. Dowdeswell was in the house, and he
stayed on with us and did all that was required. This
morning he was buried in the church of this village, close to
the house, in the simplest manner, and was followed to the
grave by my brothers and brother-in-law, Dowdeswell, Ives,
the doctor who attended him, and the servants. He had long
been ailing, and at his age (nearly 70 years) this event was
not extraordinary, but it was shocking, because so sudden
and unexpected, and no idea of danger was entertained by
himself or those about him. My father had some faults and
many foibles, but he was exposed to great disadvantages in
early youth; his education was neglected and his disposition
was spoilt. His father was useless, and worse than useless,
as a parent, and his mother (a woman of extraordinary
capacity and merit) died while he was a young man, having
been previously separated from her husband, and having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ANECDOTES OF PRINCESS CHARLOTTE.</span>
retired from the
world.<a name="FNA_18_11" id="FNA_18_11"></a><a href="#FN_18_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
The circumstances of his marriage,
and the incidents of his life, would be interesting to none
but his own family, and need not be recorded by me. He
was a man of a kind, amiable, and liberal disposition, and
what is remarkable, as he advanced in years his temper
grew less irritable and more indulgent; he was cheerful,
hospitable, and unselfish. He had at all times been a lively
companion, and without much instruction, extensive information,
or a vigorous understanding, his knowledge of the
world in the midst of which he had passed his life, his taste
and turn for humour, and his good-nature made him a very
agreeable man. He had a few intimate friends to whom he
was warmly attached, a host of acquaintance, and I do not
know that he had a single enemy. He was an affectionate
father, and ready to make any sacrifices for the happiness
and welfare of his children&mdash;in short, he was amiable and
blameless in the various relations of life, and he deserved
that his memory should be cherished as it is by us with sincere
and affectionate regret.</p>

<h3>September 18th, 1832</h3>

<p>I have been in London, at Shepperton,
and twice at Brighton to see Henry de Ros; came back yesterday.
The world is half asleep. Lord Howe returns to the Queen
as her Chamberlain, and that makes a sensation. I met at
Brighton Lady Keith [Madame de Flahaut], who told us a
great deal about French politics, which, as she is a partisan,
was not worth much, but she also gave us rather an amusing
account of the early days of the Princess Charlotte, at the time
of her escape from Warwick House in a hackney coach and
taking refuge with her mother, and of the earlier affair of
Captain Hess. The former escapade arose from her determination
to break off her marriage with the Prince of Orange,
and that from her falling suddenly in love with Prince
Augustus of Prussia, and her resolving to marry him and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
nobody else, not knowing that he was already married <i>de la
main gauche</i> in Prussia. It seems that she speedily made
known her sentiments to the Prince, and he (notwithstanding
his marriage) followed the thing up, and had two interviews
with her at her own house, which were contrived by Miss
Knight, her governess. During one of these Miss Mercer
arrived, and Miss Knight told her that Prince Augustus was
with the Princess in her room, and what a fright she (Miss
Knight) was in. Miss Mercer, who evidently had no mind
anybody should conduct such an affair for the Princess but
herself, pressed Miss Knight to go and interrupt them, which
on her declining she did herself. The King (Regent as he
was then) somehow heard of these meetings, and measures
of coercion were threatened, and it was just when an approaching
visit from him had been announced to the Princess
that she went off. Miss Mercer was in the house at the time,
and the Regent, when he came, found her there. He accused
her of being a party to the Princess&rsquo;s flight, but afterwards
either did or pretended to believe her denial, and sent her
to fetch the Princess back, which after many <i>pourparlers</i>
and the intervention of the Dukes of York and Sussex,
Brougham, and the Bishop of Salisbury, her preceptor, was
accomplished at two in the morning.</p>

<p>Hess&rsquo;s affair was an atrocity of the Princess of Wales.
She employed him to convey letters to her daughter while
she used to ride in Windsor Park, which he contrived to
deliver, and occasionally to converse with her; and on one
occasion, at Kensington, the Princess of Wales brought them
together in her own room. The Princess afterwards wrote
him some letters, not containing much harm, but idle and
improper. When the Duke of York&rsquo;s affair with Mrs. Clark
came out, and all the correspondence, she became very much
alarmed, told Miss Mercer the whole story, and employed her
to get back her letters to Hess. She accordingly wrote to
Hess (who was then in Spain), but he evinced a disinclination
to give them up. On his return to England she saw
him, and on his still demurring she threatened to put the
affair into the Duke of York&rsquo;s hands, which frightened him,
and then he surrendered them, and signed a paper declaring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">BELGIUM, SPAIN, FRANCE.</span>
he had given up everything. The King afterwards heard of
this affair, and questioning the Princess, she told him everything.
He sent for Miss Mercer, and desired to see the
letters, and then to keep them. This she refused. This
Captain Hess was a short, plump, vulgar-looking man,
afterwards lover to the Queen of Naples, mother of the
present King, an amour that was carried on under the
auspices of the Margravine at her villa in the Strada Nova
at Naples. It was, however, detected, and Hess was sent
away from Naples, and never allowed to return. I remember
finding him at Turin (married), when he was lamenting his
hard fate in being excluded from that <i>Paradiso</i> Naples.</p>

<h3>September 28th, 1832</h3>

<p>At Stoke from the 22nd to the 26th,
then to the Grove, and returned yesterday; at the former
place Madame de Lieven, Alvanley, Melbourne; tolerably
pleasant; question of war again. The Dutch King makes
a stir, and threatens to bombard the town of Antwerp; the
French offered to march, and put their troops in motion, but
Leopold begged they would not, and chose rather to await
the effect of more conferences, which began with great vigour
a few days ago. What they find to say to each other for eight
or ten hours a day for several consecutive days it is hard to
guess, as the question is of the simplest kind. The King
of Holland will not give up the citadel of Antwerp, nor
consent to the free navigation of the Scheldt; the Belgians
insist on these concessions; the Conference says they shall
be granted, but Russia, Prussia, and Austria will not coerce
the Dutchman; England and France will, if the others don&rsquo;t
object. A French army is in motion, and a French fleet is off
Spithead; so probably something will come of it. Nothing
has damaged this Government more than these protracted
and abortive conferences.</p>

<p>Four days ago there was a report that the King of Spain
was dead, accompanied with a good many particulars, and
all the world began speculating as to the succession, but
yesterday came news that he was not dead, but better. Pedro
and Miguel are fighting at Oporto with some appearance of
spirit; Miguel is the favourite. The French Government is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
represented to be in a wretched state, squabbling and feeble,
and nobody is inclined to be Minister. Dupin was very near
it, but refused because Louis Philippe would not make him
President of the Council. The King is determined to be his
own Minister, and can get nobody to take office on these
terms. They think it will end in Dupin. The present
Government declares it cannot meet the Chambers until
Antwerp is evacuated by the Dutch and the Duchesse de
Berri departed out of France or taken. This heroine, much
to the annoyance of her family, is dodging about in La Vendée
and doing rather harm than good to her cause. The Dauphiness
passed through London, when our Queen very politely
went to visit her. She has not a shadow of doubt of the
restoration of her nephew, and thinks nothing questionable
but the time. She told Madame de Lieven this. I talked to
Madame de Lieven about war, and added that if any did
break out it would be the war of opinion which Canning had
predicted. She said yes, and that the monarchical principle
(as she calls the absolute principle) would then crush the
other.</p>

<p>I came up with Melbourne to London. He is uneasy
about the state of the country&mdash;about the desire for change
and the general restlessness that prevails. We discussed the
different members of the Government, and he agreed that
John Russell had acted unwarrantably in making the speech
he did the other day at Torquay about the Ballot, which,
though hypothetical, was nothing but an invitation to
the advocates of Ballot to agitate for it; this, too, from a
Cabinet Minister! Then comes an awkward sort of explanation,
that what he said was in his <i>individual</i> capacity, as if
he had any right so to speak. Melbourne spoke of Brougham,
who he said was tossed about in perpetual caprices, that he
was fanciful and sensitive, and actuated by all sorts of littlenesses,
even with regard to people so insignificant that it is
difficult to conceive how he can ever think about them; that
he is conservative, but under the influence of his old connexions,
particularly of the Saints. His friends are so often
changed that it is not easy to follow him in this respect.

<span class="pagehead">CONVERSATION WITH LORD MELBOURNE.</span>
Durham used to be one; now he hates him; he has a high
opinion of Sefton! of his judgment!! What is talent, what
are great abilities, when one sees the gigantic intellect of
Brougham so at fault? Not only does the world manage to go
on when little wisdom guides it, but how ill it may go on with a
great deal of <i>talent</i>, which, however, is different from <i>wisdom</i>.
He asked me what I thought of Richmond, and I told him that
he was ignorant and narrow-minded, but a good sort of
fellow, only appearing to me, who had known him all my life,
in an odd place as a Cabinet Minister. He said he was sharp,
quick, the King liked him, and he stood up to Durham more
than any other man in the Cabinet, and that altogether he was
not unimportant; so that the ingredients of this Cabinet seem
to be put there to neutralise one another, and to be good for
nothing else; because Durham has an overbearing temper,
and his father-in-law is weak, there must be a man without
any other merit than spirit to curb that temper. He talked of
Ireland, and the difficulty of settling the question there, that
the Archbishop of Canterbury was willing to reform the
Church, but not to alienate any of its revenues. &lsquo;Not,&rsquo; I
asked, &lsquo;for the payment of a Catholic clergy?&rsquo; &lsquo;No, not
from Protestant uses.&rsquo; I told him there was nothing to be
done but to pull down the edifice and rebuild it. He said you
would have all the Protestants against you, but he did not
appear to differ. To this things must come at last. Melbourne
is exceedingly anxious to keep Lord Hill and Fitzroy
Somerset at the head of the army, from which the violent of
his party would gladly oust them, but he evidently contemplates
the possibility of having occasion for the army, and does
not wish to tamper with the service or play any tricks with
it. It is curious to see the working and counterworking of
his real opinions and principles with his false position, and
the mixture of bluntness, facility and shrewdness, discretion,
levity and seriousness, which, colouring his mind and character
by turns, make up the strange compound of his
thoughts and his actions.</p>

<h3>London, October 7th, 1832</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
I went to Newmarket on the 30th
of September, to Panshanger on the 5th, and came to town
on the 6th. Great fears entertained of war; the obstinacy
of the Dutch King, the appointment of Soult to be Prime
Minister of France, and the ambiguous conduct of the Allied
Courts look like war. Miguel has attacked Oporto without
success; but, as he nearly destroyed the English and French
battalions, he will probably soon get possession of the city.
It is clear that all Portugal is for him, which we may be sorry
for, but so it is. The iniquity of his cause does not appear
to affect it.</p>

<h3>October 12th, 1832</h3>

<p>Lady Cowper told me at Panshanger that
Palmerston said all the difficulties of the Belgian question
came from Matuscewitz, who was insolent and obstinate, and
astute in making objections; that it was the more provoking
as he had been recalled some time ago (the Greek business
being settled, for which he came), and Palmerston and some
of the others had asked the Emperor to allow him to stay here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">TORY ATTEMPTS TO FORM A MINISTRY.</span>
on account of his usefulness in drawing up the minutes of the
proceedings of the Conference; that Lieven had by no means
wished him to stay, but could not object when the others
desired it. Accordingly he remained, and now he annoys
Palmerston to death. All this she wrote to Madame de
Lieven, who replied that it was not the fault of Matuscewitz,
and that he and Lieven agreed perfectly. She talked,
however, rather more pacific language. This clever, intriguing,
agreeable diplomatess has renewed her friendship
with the Duke of Wellington, to which he does not object,
though she will hardly ever efface the impression her former
conduct made upon him. My journal is getting intolerably
stupid, and entirely barren of events. I would take to miscellaneous
and private matters if any fell in my way, but
what can I make out of such animals as I herd with and
such occupations as I am engaged in?</p>

<h3>Euston, October 26th, 1832</h3>

<p>Went to Downham on Sunday
last; the Duke of Rutland, the Walewskis, Lord Burghersh,
and Hope. Came here on Wednesday morning; the
usual party. At Downham I picked up a good deal from
Arbuthnot (who was very garrulous) of a miscellaneous description,
of which the most curious and important was the
entire confirmation of (what I before suspected) the ill blood
that exists between the Duke of Wellington and Peel;
though the interests of party keep them on decent terms,
they dislike one another, and the Duke&rsquo;s friends detest Peel
still more than the Duke does himself. He told me all that
had passed at the time of the blow-up of the present Government,
which I have partly recorded from a former conversation
with him, and his story certainly proves that the
Duke (though I think he committed an enormous error in judgment)
was not influenced by any motives of personal ambition.</p>

<p>As soon as the King sent for Lyndhurst the latter went
to the Duke, who (as is known) agreed to form a Government,
never doubting that he was to be himself Prime
Minister. Lyndhurst went to Peel, who declined to take
office, and he then went to Baring. Lyndhurst and Arbuthnot
sent for Baring out of the House of Commons, and took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
him to old Bankes&rsquo; house in Palace Yard, where they had
their conversation with him. He begged for time to consider
of it, and to be allowed to consult Peel, to which they assented.
He afterwards agreed, but on condition that Manners
Sutton should also be in the Cabinet. Lyndhurst had
about the same time made overtures to Manners Sutton,
and though nothing was finally settled it was understood he
would accept them. So matters stood, when one day (it
must have been the Wednesday or Thursday) Vesey Fitzgerald
called on the Arbuthnots, and in a conversation
about the different arrangements he intimated that Manners
Sutton expected to be Prime Minister, and on asking him
more particularly they found that this was also his own
impression. The next morning Arbuthnot went off to Lyndhurst&rsquo;s
house, where he arrived before Lyndhurst was
dressed, and told him what had fallen from Fitzgerald, and
asked what it could mean. Lyndhurst answered very
evasively, but promised to have the matter cleared up.
Arbuthnot, not satisfied, went to the Duke and told him
what had passed, and added his conviction that there was
some such project on foot (to make Sutton Premier) of which
he was not aware. The Duke said he did not care a farthing
who was Premier, and that if it was thought desirable that
Sutton should be he had not the smallest objection, and was
by no means anxious to fill the post himself. I asked
whether the Duke would have taken office if Sutton had
been Minister, and was told that nothing was settled, but
probably not.</p>

<p>The same day there was a meeting at Apsley House, at
which the Duke, Lyndhurst, Baring, Ellenborough, and (I
think) Rosslyn or Aberdeen, or both, were present, and to
which Sutton came, and held forth for nearly four hours
upon the position of their affairs and his coming into office.
He talked such incredible nonsense (as I have before
related) that when he was gone they all lifted up their
hands and with one voice pronounced the impossibility of
forming any Government under such a head. Baring was
then asked why he had made Sutton&rsquo;s coming into office
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MANNERS SUTTON PROPOSED AS PREMIER.</span>
the condition of his own acceptance, and why he had
wished him to be Prime Minister. He said that he had
never desired any such thing himself, and had hardly any
acquaintance with Sutton, except that as speaker he was
civil to him, and he dined with him once a year, but that
when he had gone to consult Peel, Peel had advised him
to insist upon having Sutton, and to put him at the head of
the Government. This avowal led to further examination
into what had passed, and it came out that when Lyndhurst
went to Peel, Peel pressed Manners Sutton upon him,
refusing to take office himself, but promising to support the
new Government, and urging Lyndhurst to offer the Premiership
to Sutton. At the same time he put Sutton up to
this, and desired him to refuse every office except that of
Premier. Accordingly, when Lyndhurst went to Sutton, the
latter said he would be Prime Minister or nothing, and
Lyndhurst had the folly to promise it to him. Thus matters
stood when Lady Cowley, who was living at Apsley House,
and got hold of what was passing, went and told it to her
brother, Lord Salisbury, who lost no time in imparting it to
some of the other High Tory Lords, who all agreed that it
would not do to have Sutton at the head of the Government,
and that the Duke was the only man for them. On Saturday
the great dinner at the Conservative Club took place, at
which a number of Tories, principally Peers, with the Duke
and Peel, were present. A great many speeches were made,
all full of enthusiasm for the Duke, and expressing a determination
to support <i>his</i> Government. Peel was in very ill
humour and said little; the Duke spoke much in honour of
Peel, applauding his conduct and saying that the difference
of their positions justified each in his different line. The
next day some of the Duke&rsquo;s friends met, and agreed that
the unanimous desire for the Duke&rsquo;s being at the head of
the Government which had been expressed at that dinner,
together with the unfitness of Sutton, proved the absolute
necessity of the Duke&rsquo;s being Premier, and it was resolved
that a communication to this effect should be made to Peel.
Aberdeen charged himself with it and went to Peel&rsquo;s house,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
where Sutton was at the time. Peel came to Aberdeen in
a very bad humour, said he saw from what had passed at
the dinner that nobody was thought of but the Duke, and
he should wash his hands of the whole business; that he had
already declined having anything to do with the Government,
and to that determination he should adhere. The
following Monday the whole thing was at an end.</p>

<p>I am not sure that I have stated these occurrences
exactly as they were told me. There may be errors in the
order of the interviews and <i>pourparlers</i>, and in the verbal
details, but the substance is correct, and may be summed up
to this effect: that Peel, full of ambition, but of caution,
animated by deep dislike and jealousy of the Duke (which
policy induced him to conceal, but which temper betrayed),
thought to make Manners Sutton play the part of Addington,
while he was to be another Pitt; he fancied that he
could gain in political character, by an opposite line of conduct,
all that the Duke would lose; and he resolved that a
Government should be formed the existence of which should
depend upon himself. Manners Sutton was to be his
creature; he would have dictated every measure of Government;
he would have been their protector in the House of
Commons; and, as soon as the fitting moment arrived, he
would have dissolved this miserable Ministry and placed
himself at the head of affairs. All these deep-laid schemes,
and constant regard of self, form a strong contrast to the
simplicity and heartiness of the Duke&rsquo;s conduct, and make
the two men appear in a very different light from that in
which they did at first. Peel acted right from bad motives,
the Duke wrong from good ones. The Duke put himself
forward, and encountered all the obloquy and reproach to
which he knew he exposed himself, and having done so,
cheerfully offered to resign the power to another. Peel endeavoured
to seize the power, but to shield himself from
responsibility and danger. It is a melancholy proof of the
dearth of talent and the great capacity of the man that,
notwithstanding the detection of his practices and his
motives, the Tories are compelled still to keep well with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">EMBARGO ON DUTCH SHIPS.</span>
him and to accept him for their leader. No cordiality,
however, can exist again between him and the Duke and
his friends, and, should the Whig Government be expelled,
the animosity and disunion engendered by these circumstances
will make it extremely difficult to form a Tory
Administration. [In a short time it was all made up&mdash;forgiven,
if not forgotten.]</p>

<h3>November 7th, 1832</h3>

<p>Came to town on Sunday. The answer
of the Dutch King to the demand of England and France
that he should give up Antwerp was anxiously expected.
It arrived on Monday afternoon, and was a refusal. Accordingly
a Council met yesterday, at which an order was
made for laying an embargo on Dutch merchant ships, which
are to be sequestrated, but not confiscated. The French
army marches forthwith, and Palmerston told me they expected
two or three days of bombardment would suffice for
the capture of the citadel, after which the French would
retire within their own frontier. The combined fleets will
remain at the Downs, for they can do nothing on the coast
of Holland at this season of the year. There is a good deal
of jealousy and no friendly spirit between the English and
French sailors; and the Duke of Richmond told me yesterday
that the Deal pilots desired nothing so much as to get the
French ships into a scrape. Great excitement prevails about
this Dutch question, which is so complicated that at this
moment I do not understand its merits. Matuscewitz, however,
who is opposed <i>totis viribus</i> to the policy of England
and France, told me that nobody could have behaved worse
than the King of Holland has done, shuffling and tricking
throughout; but they say he is so situated at home that he
could not give way if he would. A few days must now decide
the question of war or peace. All the Ministers, except
Brougham, Lord Holland, Grant, and Carlisle, were at the
Council yesterday&mdash;the Archbishop of Canterbury for a prayer
(for we omit no opportunity of offering supplications or returning
thanks to Heaven), and the new Lord Chief Justice
to be sworn a Privy Councillor.</p>

<p>Lord Tenterden died on Sunday night, and no time was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
lost in appointing Denman as his successor. Coming as he
does after four of the greatest lawyers who ever sat upon the
Bench, this choice will not escape severe censure; for the
reputation of Denman as a lawyer is not high, and he has
been one of the most inefficient Attorneys-General who ever
filled the office. It has been a constant matter of complaint
on the part of the Government and their friends that the
law officers of the Crown gave them no assistance, but, on
the contrary, got them into scrapes. Denman is an honourable
man, and has been a consistent politician; latterly, of
course, a Radical of considerable vehemence, if not of violence.
The other men who were mentioned as successors to
Tenterden were Lyndhurst, Scarlett, and James Parke. The
latter is the best of the puisne judges, and might have been
selected if all political considerations and political connexions
had been disregarded. Lyndhurst will be overwhelmed with
anguish and disappointment at finding himself for ever excluded
from the great object of his ambition, and in which
his professional claims are so immeasurably superior to those
of his successful competitor; nor has he lost it by any sacrifice
of interest to honour, but merely from the unfortunate
issue of his political speculations. When he was made Chief
Baron a regular compact was made, a secret article, that he
should succeed on Tenterden&rsquo;s death to the Chief Justiceship;
which bargain was of course cancelled by his declaration
of war on the Reform question and his consequent
breach with Lord Grey; though by far the fittest man, he
was now out of the question. It will be the more grating
as he has just evinced his high capabilities by pronouncing
in the Court of Exchequer one of the ablest judgments (in
Small <i>v.</i> Attwood) that were ever delivered. [It was afterwards
reversed by the House of Lords.] Scarlett, who had
been a Whig for forty years, and who has long occupied the
first place in the Court of King&rsquo;s Bench, would have been
the man if his political dissociation from his old connexions,
and his recent hostility to them, had not also cancelled his
claims; so that every rival being set aside from one cause
or another, Denman, by one of the most extraordinary pieces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DENMAN LORD CHIEF JUSTICE.</span>
of good fortune that ever happened to man, finds himself
elevated to this great office, the highest object of a lawyer&rsquo;s
ambition, and, in my opinion, one of the most enviable
stations an Englishman can attain. It is said that as a Common
Serjeant he displayed the qualities of a good judge,
and his friends confidently assert that he will make a very
good Chief Justice; but his legal qualifications are admitted
to be very inferior to those of his predecessors. [He made
a very bad one, but was personally popular and generally
respected for his high, and honourable moral character.]</p>

<p>Tenterden was a remarkable man, and his elevation did
great credit to the judgment which selected him, and which
probably was Eldon&rsquo;s. He had never led a cause, but he
was a profound lawyer, and appears to have had a mind
fraught with the spirit and genius of the law, and not narrowed
and trammelled by its subtleties and technicalities.
In spite of his low birth, want of oratorical power, and of
personal dignity, he was greatly revered and dreaded on the
Bench. He was an austere, but not an ill-humoured judge;
his manners were remarkably plain and unpolished, though
not vulgar. He was an elegant scholar, and cultivated classical
literature to the last. Brougham, whose congenial
tastes delighted in his classical attainments, used to bandy
Latin and Greek with him from the Bar to the Bench; and
he has more than once told me of his sending Tenterden
Greek verses of John Williams&rsquo;, of which the next day
Tenterden gave him a translation in Latin verse. He is
supposed to have died very rich. Denman was taken into
the King&rsquo;s closet before the Council, when he was sworn in;
the King took no particular notice of him, and the appointment
is not, probably, very palatable to his Majesty.</p>

<h3>November 15th, 1832</h3>

<p>Sheriff business at the Exchequer Court
on Monday; saw Lyndhurst and Denman meet and shake
hands with much politeness and grimace.</p>

<h3>November 20th, 1832</h3>

<p>Dined at Holland House the day before
yesterday; Lady Holland is unwell, fancies she must dine at
five o&rsquo;clock, and exerts her power over society by making everybody
go out there at that hour, though nothing can be more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
inconvenient than thus shortening the day, and nothing more
tiresome than such lengthening of the evening. Rogers and
Luttrell were staying there. The <i>tableau</i> of the house is
this:&mdash;Before dinner, Lady Holland affecting illness and
almost dissolution, but with a very respectable appetite, and
after dinner in high force and vigour; Lord Holland, with
his chalkstones and unable to walk, lying on his couch in
very good spirits and talking away; Luttrell and Rogers
walking about, ever and anon looking despairingly at the
clock and making short excursions from the drawing-room;
Allen surly and disputatious, poring over the newspapers,
and replying in monosyllables (generally negative) to whatever
is said to him. The grand topic of interest, far exceeding
the Belgian or Portuguese questions, was the illness of
Lady Holland&rsquo;s page, who has got a tumour in his thigh.
This &lsquo;little creature,&rsquo; as Lady Holland calls a great hulking
fellow of about twenty, is called &lsquo;Edgar,&rsquo; his real name being
Tom or Jack, which he changed on being elevated to his
present dignity, as the Popes do when they are elected to
the tiara. More rout is made about him than other people
are permitted to make about their children, and the inmates
of Holland House are invited and compelled to go and sit
with and amuse him. Such is the social despotism of this
strange house, which presents an odd mixture of luxury and
constraint, of enjoyment physical and intellectual, with an
alloy of small <i>désagréments</i>. Talleyrand generally comes at
ten or eleven o&rsquo;clock, and stays as long as they will let him.
Though everybody who goes there finds something to abuse
or to ridicule in the mistress of the house, or its ways, all
continue to go; all like it more or less; and whenever, by
the death of either, it shall come to an end, a vacuum will
be made in society which nothing will supply. It is the
house of all Europe; the world will suffer by the loss; and
it may with truth be said that it will &lsquo;eclipse the gaiety of
nations.&rsquo;</p>

<h3>November 27th, 1832</h3>

<p>At Roehampton from Saturday till
Monday. The Chancellor had been there a few days before,
from whom Lord Dover had picked up the gossip of the Government.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE SPEAKERSHIP.</span>
There had been a fresh breeze with Durham, who it
seems has returned from Russia more odious than ever. His
violence and insolence, as usual, were vented on Lord Grey,
and the rest of the Cabinet, as heretofore, are obliged to
submit. I have since heard from the Duke of Richmond that
the cause of this last storm was something relating to Church
Reform, and that he had been forced to knock under. I fancy
he wanted to go much further than the others, probably to
unfrock the Bishop of Durham and Bishop Phillpotts, the
former because he is a greater man in the county than himself,
and the latter from old and inextinguishable hatred and
animosity.</p>

<p>There has been another dispute about the Speakership.
All the Cabinet except Althorp want to put Abercromby in
the chair, and Althorp insists on having Littleton. The
former is in all respects the best choice, and the man whom
they ought, from his long connexion with the Whigs and
his consistency and respectability, to propose, but Althorp
thought fit to commit himself in some way to Littleton, who
has no claims to be compared with those of Abercromby
(having been half his life in opposition to the present Government),
and he obstinately insists upon the expectations held
out to him being realised. Lord Grey, though very anxious
for Abercromby, thinks it necessary to defer to the leader of
the House of Commons, and the consequence is a very disagreeable
dispute on the subject. Abercromby is greatly
mortified at being postponed to Littleton, and not the less
as Althorp has always been his friend. The language of
Dover, who is a sort of jackal to Brougham, clearly indicates
the desire of that worthy to get rid of Lord Grey and put
himself in his place. All these little squabbles elicit some
disparaging remarks on Lord Grey&rsquo;s weakness, folly, or
cupidity. <i>Hæret lateri</i>&mdash;the offer of the Attorney-Generalship,
and the day of vengeance is intended to
come.<a name="FNA_19_01" id="FNA_19_01"></a><a href="#FN_19_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_19_01" id="FN_19_01"></a><a href="#FNA_19_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[This refers to Lord Grey&rsquo;s having offered the Attorney-Generalship
to Brougham when Government was formed.]</p></div>

<p>After considerable delay Horne and Campbell were
appointed Attorney- and Solicitor-General; the delay was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
occasioned by ineffectual attempts to dispose of Horne elsewhere.
They wanted to get some puisne judge to resign,
and to put Horne on the Bench, but they could not make
any such arrangement, so Horne is Attorney. Pepys was to
have been Solicitor if the thing could have been managed.
I don&rsquo;t think I picked up anything else, except that the King
was very averse to the French attack upon Antwerp, and
consented to the hand-in-hand arrangement between France
and England with considerable reluctance. The fact is
he hates this Government so much that he dislikes all
they do.</p>

<p>Lord Lansdowne is just come from Paris, and gives a
flourishing account of the prospects of King Louis Philippe
and his Government, but as he is the Duc de Broglie&rsquo;s intimate
friend his opinion may be prejudiced. The King appears
certainly to have rather gained than not by the attack which
was made on him, from the coolness and courage he evinced,
and it is a great point to have proved that he is not a coward.</p>

<h3>Brighton, December 14th, 1832</h3>

<p>Came here last Wednesday
week; Council on the Monday for the dissolution; place very
full, bustling, gay, and amusing. I am staying in De Ros&rsquo;s
house with Alvanley; Chesterfields, Howes, Lievens, Cowpers,
all at Brighton, and plenty of occupation in visiting,
gossiping, dawdling, riding, and driving; a very idle life, and
impossible to do anything. The Court very active, vulgar,
and hospitable; King, Queen, Princes, Princesses, bastards,
and attendants constantly trotting about in every direction:
the election noisy and dull&mdash;the Court candidate beaten and
two Radicals elected. Everybody talking of the siege of
Antwerp and the elections. So, with plenty of animation, and
discussion, and curiosity, I like it very well. Lord Howe
is devoted to the Queen, and never away from her. She
receives his attentions, but demonstrates nothing in return;
he is like a boy in love with this frightful spotted Majesty,
while his delightful wife is laid up (with a sprained ancle
and dislocated joint) on her couch.</p>

<h3>Brighton, December 17th, 1832</h3>

<p>On Sunday I heard Anderson
preach. He does not write his sermons, but preaches from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">MR. GULLY.</span>
notes; very eloquent, voice and manner perfect, one of the
best I ever heard, both preacher and reader.</p>

<p>The borough elections are nearly over, and have satisfied
the Government. They do not seem to be bad on the whole;
the metropolitans have sent good men enough, and there was
no tumult in the town. At Hertford Duncombe was routed
by Salisbury&rsquo;s long purse. He hired such a numerous mob
besides that he carried all before him. Some very bad characters
have been returned; among the worst, Faithful here;
Gronow at Stafford; Gully, Pontefract; Cobbett, Oldham;
though I am glad that Cobbett is in Parliament. Gully&rsquo;s
history is extraordinary. He was taken out of prison
twenty-five or thirty years ago by Mellish to fight Pierce,
surnamed the &lsquo;Game Chicken,&rsquo; being then a butcher&rsquo;s apprentice;
he fought him and was beaten. He afterwards fought
Belcher (I believe), and Gresson twice, and left the prize-ring
with the reputation of being the best man in it. He
then took to the turf, was successful, established himself at
Newmarket, where he kept a hell, and began a system of
corruption of trainers, jockeys, and boys, which put the
secrets of all Newmarket at his disposal, and in a few years
made him rich. At the same time he connected himself
with Mr. Watt in the north, by betting for him, and this
being at the time when Watt&rsquo;s stable was very successful,
he won large sums of money by his horses. Having become
rich he embarked in a great coal speculation, which answered
beyond his hopes, and his shares soon yielded immense
profits. His wife, who was a coarse, vulgar woman, in the
meantime died, and he afterwards married the daughter of
an innkeeper, who proved as gentlewomanlike as the other
had been the reverse, and who is very pretty besides. He
now gradually withdrew from the betting ring as a regular
blackleg, still keeping horses, and betting occasionally in
large sums, and about a year or two ago, having previously
sold the Hare Park to Sir Mark Wood, where he lived for
two or three years, he bought a property near Pontefract,
and settled down (at Ackworth Park) as John Gully, Esq., a
gentleman of fortune. At the Reform dissolution he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
pressed to come forward as candidate for Pontefract, but
after some hesitation he declined. Latterly he has taken great
interest in politics, and has been an ardent Reformer and a
liberal subscriber for the advancement of the cause. When
Parliament was about to be dissolved, he was again invited
to stand for Pontefract by a numerous deputation; he again
hesitated, but finally accepted; Lord Mexborough withdrew,
and he was elected without opposition. In person he is tall
and finely formed, full of strength and grace, with delicate
hands and feet, his face coarse and with a bad expression,
his head set well on his shoulders, and remarkably graceful
and even dignified in his actions and manners; totally without
education, he has strong sense, discretion, reserve, and a
species of good taste which has prevented, in the height of
his fortunes, his behaviour from ever transgressing the
bounds of modesty and respect, and he has gradually separated
himself from the rabble of bettors and blackguards of
whom he was once the most conspicuous, and tacitly asserted
his own independence and acquired gentility without ever
presuming towards those whom he has been accustomed to
regard with deference. His position is now more anomalous
than ever, for a member of Parliament is a great man,
though there appear no reasons why the suffrages of the
blackguards of Pontefract should place him in different
social relations towards us than those in which we mutually
stood before.</p>

<h3>Petworth, December 20th, 1832</h3>

<p>Came here yesterday. It is a
very grand place; house magnificent and full of fine objects,
both ancient and modern; the Sir Joshuas and Vandykes
particularly interesting, and a great deal of all sorts that is
worth seeing. Lord Egremont was eighty-one the day before
yesterday, and is still healthy, with faculties and memory
apparently unimpaired. He has reigned here for sixty years
with great authority and influence. He is shrewd, eccentric,
and benevolent, and has always been munificent and charitable
in his own way; he patronises the arts and fosters
rising genius. Painters and sculptors find employment and
welcome in his house; he has built a gallery which is full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">EARL OF EGREMONT.</span>
pictures and statues, some of which are very fine, and the
pictures scattered through the house are interesting and
curious. Lord Egremont hates ceremony, and can&rsquo;t bear to be
personally meddled with; he likes people to come and go as
it suits them, and say nothing about it, never to take leave of
him. The party here consists of the Cowpers, his own family,
a Lady E. Romney, two nieces, Mrs. Tredcroft a neighbour,
Ridsdale a parson, Wynne, Turner, the great landscape
painter, and a young artist of the name of Lucas, whom Lord
Egremont is bringing into notice, and who will owe his fortune
(if he makes it) to him. Lord Egremont is enormously
rich, and lives with an abundant though not very refined
hospitality. The house wants modern comforts, and the
servants are rustic and uncouth; but everything is good, and
it all bears an air of solid and aristocratic grandeur. The
stud groom told me there are 300 horses of different sorts
here. His course, however, is nearly run, and he has the
mortification of feeling that, though surrounded with children
and grandchildren, he is almost the last of his race, and that
his family is about to be extinct. Two old brothers and one
childless nephew are all that are left of the Wyndhams, and
the latter has been many years married. All his own children
are illegitimate, but he has everything in his power,
though nobody has any notion of the manner in which he
will dispose of his property. It is impossible not to reflect
upon the prodigious wealth of the Earls of Northumberland,
and of the proud Duke of Somerset who married the last
heiress of that house, the betrothed of three husbands. All
that Lord Egremont has, all the Duke of Northumberland&rsquo;s
property, and the Duke of Rutland&rsquo;s Cambridgeshire estate
belonged to them, which together is probably equivalent to
between 200,000&#8467;. and 300,000&#8467;. a year. Banks told me that
the Northumberland property, when settled on Sir H. Smithson,
was not above 12,000&#8467;. a
year.<a name="FNA_19_02" id="FNA_19_02"></a><a href="#FN_19_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

[The eleventh Earl of Northumberland, Joscelyn Percy, died in 1670,
leaving an only daughter, who married Charles Seymour, ninth Duke of
Somerset. This lady is described as &lsquo;the betrothed of three husbands,&rsquo;
because she was married at fourteen to Henry Cavendish, son of the Duke
of Newcastle, who died in the following year. She was then affianced to
Thomas Thynne of Longleat, who was assassinated in 1682; and at last
married to the Duke of Somerset. The eldest son of this marriage, Algernon
Seymour, who succeeded to the Dukedom of Somerset in 1748, was created
Earl of Northumberland on the 2nd of October, 1749, and Earl of Egremont
on the following day, with remainder (as regards the latter title) to his
nephew Sir Charles Wyndham, who succeeded him in February 1750. The
Earldom of Northumberland passed at the same time to Sir Hugh Smithson,
son-in-law of Duke Algernon, who was created Duke of Northumberland
in 1766. The titles and the vast property of the Duke of Somerset, Earl of
Northumberland, thus came to be divided.</p>

<p>George O&rsquo;Brien Wyndham, third Earl of Egremont, to whom Mr. Greville
paid this visit, was born on the 18th of December, 1751. He was
therefore eighty-two years old at this time; but he lived five years longer,
and died in 1837, famous and beloved for his splendid hospitality and for
his liberal and judicious patronage of the arts, and likewise of the turf.]</p></div>

<h3>Brighton, December 31st, 1832</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Lady Howe gave me an account
of the offer of the Chamberlainship to her husband again.
They added the condition that he should not oppose Government,
but was not to be obliged to support them. This he
refused, and he regarded the proposal as an insult; so the
Queen was not conciliated the more. She likewise told me
that the cause of her former wrath when he was dismissed
was that neither the King nor Lord Grey told her of it, and
that if they had she would have consented to the sacrifice at
once with a good grace; but in the way it was done she
thought herself grossly ill-used. It is impossible to ascertain
the exact nature of this connexion. Howe conducts himself
towards her like a young ardent lover; he never is out of
the Pavilion, dines there almost every day, or goes every
evening, rides with her, never quitting her side, and never
takes his eyes off her. She does nothing, but she admits his
attentions and acquiesces in his devotion; at the same time
there is not the smallest evidence that she treats him as a
lover. If she did it would be soon known, for she is surrounded
by enemies. All the Fitzclarences dislike her, and
treat her more or less disrespectfully. She is aware of it,
but takes no notice. She is very civil and good-humoured
to them all; and as long as they keep within the bounds of
decency, and do not break out into actual impertinence, she
probably will continue so.</p>

<span class="pagehead">NAMIK PACHA.</span>
Two nights ago there was a great assembly after a dinner
for the reception of the Turkish Ambassador, Namik Pacha.
He was brought down by Palmerston and introduced before
dinner to the King and Queen. He is twenty-eight years
old, speaks French well, and has good manners; his dress
very simple&mdash;a red cap, black vest, trousers and boots, a gold
chain and medal round his neck. He did not take out any
lady to dinner, but was placed next the Queen. After dinner
the King made him a ridiculous speech, with abundant
flourishes about the Sultan and his friendship for him, which
is the more droll from his having been High Admiral at the
time of the battle of Navarino, to which the Pacha replied
in a sonorous voice. He admired everything, and conversed
with great ease. All the stupid, vulgar Englishwomen followed
him about as a lion with offensive curiosity.</p>

<h2>1833.</h2>

<h3>January 3rd, 1833</h3>

<p>Lady Howe begged her husband to show
me the correspondence between him and Sir Herbert Taylor
about the Chamberlainship. It is long and confused; Taylor&rsquo;s
first letter, in my opinion, very impertinent, for it reads him
a pretty severe lecture about his behaviour when he held the
office before. Howe is a foolish man, but in this business he
acted well enough, better than might have been expected.
Taylor, by the King&rsquo;s desire, proposed to him to resume the
office; and after some cavilling he agreed to do so with
liberty to vote as he pleased, but promising not to be violent.
So stood the matter on the 9th of September. He heard
nothing more of it till the 5th of November, when young
Hudson<a name="FNA_19_03" id="FNA_19_03"></a><a href="#FN_19_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
wrote by the King&rsquo;s orders to know definitely if
he meant to take it, but that if he did he must be &lsquo;neutral.&rsquo;
Howe wrote back word that on such terms he declined it. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
told him my opinion of the whole business, and added my
strenuous advice that he should immediately prevail on the
Queen to appoint somebody else. I could not tell him all
that people said, but I urged it as strongly as I could, hinting
that there were very urgent reasons for so doing. He
did not relish this advice at all, owned that he clung tenaciously
to the office, liked everything about it, and longed to
avail himself of some change of circumstances to return; and
that though he was no longer her officer, he had ever since
done all the business, and in fact was, without the name, as
much her Chamberlain as ever. Lady Howe, who is vexed to
death at the whole thing, was enchanted at my advice, and
vehemently urged him to adopt it. After he went away she
told me how glad she was at what I had said, and asked me
if people did not say and believe everything of Howe&rsquo;s connexion
with the Queen, which I told her they did. I must
say that what passed is enough to satisfy me that there is
what is called &lsquo;nothing in it&rsquo; but the folly and vanity of
being the confidential officer and councillor of this hideous
Queen, for whom he has worked himself up into a sort of
chivalrous devotion. Yesterday Howe spoke to the Queen
about it, and proposed to speak to the King; the Queen (he
says) would not hear of it, and forbad his speaking to the
King. To-day he is gone away, and I don&rsquo;t know what he
settled, probably nothing.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_19_03" id="FN_19_03"></a><a href="#FNA_19_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[&lsquo;Young Hudson&rsquo; was the page of honour who was sent to Rome in
the following year to fetch Sir Robert Peel, when, as Mr. Disraeli expressed
it, &lsquo;the hurried Hudson rushed into the chambers of his Vatican.&rsquo; He grew
up to be a very able and distinguished diplomatist, Sir James Hudson, G.C.B.,
who rendered great services to the cause of Italian independence.]</p></div>

<p>Lyndhurst dined here the day before yesterday. Finding
I knew all that had passed about the negotiations for a Tory
Government in the middle of the Reform question, he told
me his story, which differs very little from that which
Arbuthnot had told me at Downham, and fully corroborates
his account of the duplicity of Peel and the extraordinary
conduct of Lyndhurst himself. He said that as soon as he
had left the King he went to the Duke, who said he must go
directly to Peel. Peel refused to join. The Duke desired
him to go back to Peel, and propose to him to be Prime
Minister and manage everything himself. Peel still declined,
on which he went to Baring. Baring begged he might consult
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LYNDHURST AND MANNERS SUTTON.</span>
Peel, which was granted. He came back, said he would
take office, but that they must invite Manners Sutton also.
They did so, and Sutton refused. Vesey Fitzgerald, however,
suggested to Lyndhurst that if they proposed to Sutton
to be Prime Minister perhaps he would accept. Another
conversation ensued with Sutton, and a meeting was fixed at
Apsley House on the Sunday. In the meantime Lyndhurst
went down to the King and told him what had taken place,
adding that Sutton would not do, and that the Duke alone
could form a Government. At Apsley House Sutton talked
for three hours, and such infernal nonsense that Lyndhurst
was ready to go mad; nor would he decide. They pressed
him to say if he would take office or not. He said he must
wait till the next morning. They said, &lsquo;It must be very early,
then.&rsquo; In the morning he put off deciding (on some frivolous
pretext) till the afternoon. He went to the House of Commons
without having given any answer. The famous debate
ensued, and the whole game was up.</p>

<p>All this tallies with the other account, only he did not
say that Peel had desired Baring to insist on Sutton, and
had advised Sutton to take no place but the highest, nor
that he had without the Duke&rsquo;s knowledge offered Sutton
that post, and concealed from Sutton his subsequent opinion
of his incapacity and determination that he should not
have it. I asked Lyndhurst how he managed with Sutton,
and whether he had not come to Apsley House with the
impression on his mind that he was to be Premier. He
said that &lsquo;he had evaded that question with Sutton&rsquo;&mdash;that
is, all parties were deceived, while the Duke, who meant to
act nobly, suffered all the blame. He showed great disregard
of personal interests and selfish views, but I shall always
think his error was enormous. It is remarkable that this
story is so little known.</p>

<p>They had a dinner and dancing the night before last at
the Pavilion for New Year&rsquo;s Day; and the King danced a
country dance with Lord Amelius Beauclerc, an old Admiral.</p>

<h3>London, January 11th, 1833</h3>

<p>Came to town with Alvanley the
day before yesterday. Howe plucked up courage, spoke to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the King and Queen, and settled Denbigh&rsquo;s
appointment,<a name="FNA_19_04" id="FNA_19_04"></a><a href="#FN_19_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
though not without resistance on the part of their Majesties.
Lord Grey came down, and was very well received by both.
At the commerce table the King sat by him, and was full of
jokes; called him continually &lsquo;Lord Howe,&rsquo; to the great
amusement of the bystanders and of Lord Grey himself.
Munster came down and was reconciled, condescending
<i>moyennant</i> a douceur of 2,500&#8467;. to accept the Constableship
of the Round Tower. The stories of the King are uncommonly
ridiculous. He told Madame de Ludolf, who had been
Ambassadress at Constantinople, that he desired she would
recommend Lady Ponsonby to all her friends there, and she
might tell them she was the daughter of one of his late
brother&rsquo;s sultanas (Lady Jersey). His Majesty insisted on
Lord Stafford&rsquo;s taking the title of Sutherland, and ordered
Gower to send him an express to say so. One day at dinner
he asked the Duke of Devonshire &lsquo;<i>where he meant to be
buried!</i>&rsquo;</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_19_04" id="FN_19_04"></a><a href="#FNA_19_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[William Basil Percy, seventh Earl of Denbigh, was appointed Chamberlain
to Queen Adelaide at this time, and remained in the service of her
Majesty&mdash;a most excellent and devoted servant&mdash;to the close of her life.]</p></div>

<p>I received a few days ago at Brighton the draft of a Bill
of Brougham&rsquo;s for transferring the jurisdiction of the
Delegates to the Privy Council, or rather for creating a new
Court and sinking the Privy Council in it. Lord Lansdowne
sent it to me, and desired me to send him my opinion upon
it. I showed it to Stephen, and returned it to Lord
Lansdowne with some criticisms in which Stephen and I
had agreed. It is a very bungling piece of work, and one
which Lord Lansdowne ought not to consent to, the object
evidently being to make a Court of which Brougham shall
be at the head, and to transfer to it much of the authority
of the Crown, Parliament, and Privy Council; all from his
ambitious and insatiable desire of personal aggrandisement.
I have no doubt he is playing a deep game, and paving the
way for his own accession to power, striving to obtain popularity
and influence with the King; that he will succeed to a
great degree, and for a certain time, is probable. Manners
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">STATE OF THE TORY PARTY.</span>
Sutton is to be again Speaker. Althorp wrote him a very
flummery letter, and he accepted. The Government wants
to be out of the scrape they are in between Abercromby and
Littleton, and Sutton wants his peerage. Everything seems
prosperous here; the Government is strong, the House of
Commons is thought respectable on the whole and safe, trade
is brisk, funds rising, money plentiful, confidence reviving,
Tories sulky.</p>

<h3>January 17th, 1833</h3>

<p>The Government don&rsquo;t know what to do
about the embargo on the Dutch ships. Soon after they
had laid it on they made a second order allowing ships with
perishable goods to go free; and thinking the whole thing
would be soon over, they desired this might be construed
indulgently, and accordingly many ships were suffered to
pass (with goods more or less perishing) under that order.
Now that the King of Holland continues obstinate they
want to squeeze him, and to construe the order strictly.
There have been many consultations what to do, whether
they should make another order rescinding the last or
execute the former more strictly. Both are liable to objections.
The first will appear like a cruel proceeding and evidence
of uncertainty of purpose; the last will show a
capricious variation in the practice of the Privy Council, with
which the matter rests. Their wise heads were to be put
together last night to settle this knotty point.</p>

<p>Wharncliffe showed me a paper he has written, in which,
after briefly recapitulating the present state of the Tory
party and the condition of the new Parliament (particularly
as to the mode in which it was elected, or rather under what
influence), he proceeds to point out what ought to be the
course for the Tories to adopt. It is moderate and becoming
enough, and he has imparted it to the Duke of Wellington,
who concurs in his view. I wonder, however, that he is not
sick of writing papers and imparting views, after all that
passed last year, after his fruitless attempts, his false moves,
and the treatment he received at the hands of the Tories;
but he seems to have forgotten or forgiven everything, and
is disposed to wriggle himself back amongst the party upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
any terms. He acknowledges one thing fully, and that is
the desperate and woebegone condition of the party itself,
and the impossibility of their doing anything <i>now</i> as a
party.</p>

<p>Lord Lansdowne received very complacently my criticisms
on Brougham&rsquo;s Bill, and has acknowledged since he
came to town that it would not do at all as it now stands.
The King has been delighting the Whigs, and making himself
more ridiculous and contemptible by the most extravagant
civilities to the new Peers&mdash;that is, <i>to</i> Western and
about Lord Stafford. He now appears to be very fond of his
Ministers.</p>

<h3>January 19th, 1833</h3>

<p>I have at last succeeded in stimulating
Lord Lansdowne to something like resistance (or rather the
promise of it) to Brougham&rsquo;s Bill. I have proved to him
that his dignity and his interest will both be compromised
by this Bill, which intends to make the Chancellor President
of the Court, and <i>ergo</i> of the Council, and to give him all the
patronage there will be. Against these proposals he kicks;
at least he is restive, and shows symptoms of kicking, though
he will very likely be still again. I sent the Bill to Stephen,
who instantly and <i>currente calamo</i> drew up a series of objections
to it, as comprehensive and acute as all his productions
are, and last night I sent it to Leach (who hates the Chancellor),
and he has returned it to me with a strong condemnatory
reply. Stephen having told me that Howick would
be too happy to oppose this Bill, on account of the influence
it would have on Colonial matters, particularly about Canada,
I took it to him, but he declined interfering, though he concurred
in Stephen&rsquo;s remarks.</p>

<h3>January 22nd, 1833</h3>

<p>Dined with Talleyrand the day before
yesterday. Nobody there but his <i>attachés</i>. After dinner he
told me about his first residence in England, and his acquaintance
with Fox and Pitt. He always talks in a kind
of affectionate tone about the former, and is now meditating
a visit to Mrs. Fox at St. Anne&rsquo;s Hill, where he may see her
surrounded with the busts, pictures, and recollections of her
husband. He delights to dwell on the simplicity, gaiety,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">VISIT TO HARTWELL.</span>
childishness, and profoundness of Fox. I asked him if he
had ever known Pitt. He said that Pitt came to Rheims to
learn French, and he was there at the same time on a visit
to the Archbishop, his uncle (whom I remember at
Hartwell,<a name="FNA_19_05" id="FNA_19_05"></a><a href="#FN_19_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
a very old prelate with the tic-douloureux), and that he and
Pitt lived together for nearly six weeks, reciprocally teaching
each other French and English. After Chauvelin had superseded
him, and that he and Chauvelin had disagreed, he
went to live near Epsom (at Juniper Hall) with Madame de
Staël; afterwards they came to London, and in the meantime
Pitt had got into the hands of the <i>émigrés</i>, who persuaded
him to send Talleyrand away, and accordingly he
received orders to quit England in twenty-four hours. He
embarked on board a vessel for America, but was detained in
the river off Greenwich. Dundas sent to him, and asked
him to come and stay with him while the ship was detained,
but he said he would not set his foot on English ground
again, and remained three weeks on board the ship in the
river. It is strange to hear M. de Talleyrand talk at
seventy-eight. He opens the stores of his memory and pours
forth a stream on any subject connected with his past life.
Nothing seems to have escaped from that great treasury of
bygone events.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_19_05" id="FN_19_05"></a><a href="#FNA_19_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[Mr. Greville had paid a visit with his father to the little Court of
Louis XVIII. at Hartwell about two years before the Restoration, when he
was eighteen years of age. His narrative of this visit has been printed in
the fifth volume of the &lsquo;Miscellany of the Philobiblon Society,&rsquo; but it may
not be inappropriately inserted here.]</p>

<p class="center">A VISIT TO HARTWELL.</p>

<p style="text-align: right"><i>April 14th, 1814.</i></p>

<p>I have often determined to commit to paper as much as I can remember of my
visit to Hartwell; and, as the King is about to ascend the throne of his ancestors,
it is not uninteresting to recall to mind the particulars of a visit paid to him while
in exile and in poverty.</p>

<p>About two years ago my father and I went to Hartwell by invitation of the
King. We dressed at Aylesbury, and proceeded to Hartwell in the afternoon.
We had previously taken a walk in the environs of the town, and had met the
Duchesse d&rsquo;Angoulême on horseback, accompanied by a Madame Choisi. At five
o&rsquo;clock we set out to Hartwell. The house is large, but in a dreary, disagreeable
situation. The King had completely altered the interior, having subdivided almost
all the apartments in order to lodge a greater number of people. There were
numerous outhouses, in some of which small shops had been established by the
servants, interspersed with gardens, so that the place resembled a little town.</p>

<p>Upon entering the house we were conducted by the Duc de Grammont into the
King&rsquo;s private apartment. He received us most graciously and shook hands with
both of us. This apartment was exceedingly small, hardly larger than a closet,
and I remarked pictures of the late King and Queen, Madame Elizabeth, and the
Dauphin, Louis XVII., hanging on the walls. The King had a manner of swinging
his body backwards and forwards, which caused the most unpleasant sensations
in that small room, and made my father feel something like being sea-sick. The
room was just like a cabin, and the motions of his Majesty exactly resembled the
heaving of a ship. After our audience with the King we were taken to the <i>salon</i>
a large room with a billiard table at one end. Here the party assembled before
dinner, to all of whom we were presented&mdash;the Duchesse d&rsquo;Angoulême, Monsieur
the Duc d&rsquo;Angoulême, the Duc de Berri, the Prince and Princess de Condé
(<i>ci-devant</i> Madame de Monaco), and a vast number of ducs, &amp;c.; Madame la
Duchesse de Serron (a little old <i>dame d&rsquo;honneur</i> to Madame d&rsquo;Angoulême), the Duc
de Lorges, the Duc d&rsquo;Auray, the Archevêque de Rheims (an infirm old prelate,
tortured with the tic-douloureux), and many others whose names I cannot remember.
At a little after six dinner was announced, when we went into the next
room, the King walking out first. The dinner was extremely plain, consisting of
very few dishes, and no wines except port and sherry. His Majesty did the
honours himself, and was very civil and agreeable. We were a very short time at
table, and the ladies and gentlemen all got up together. Each of the ladies folded
up her napkin, tied it round with a bit of ribbon, and carried it away. After
dinner we returned to the drawing-room and drank coffee. The whole party
remained in conversation about a quarter of an hour, when the King retired to
his closet, upon which all repaired to their separate apartments. Whenever the
King came in or went out of the room, Madame d&rsquo;Angoulême made him a low
curtsy, which he returned by bowing and kissing his hand. This little ceremony
never failed to take place. After the party had separated we were taken to the
Duc de Grammont&rsquo;s apartments, where we drank tea. After remaining there
about three quarters of an hour we went to the apartment of Madame d&rsquo;Angoulême,
where a great part of the company were assembled, and where we stayed
about a quarter of an hour. After this we descended again to the drawing-room,
where several card tables were laid out. The King played at whist with the
Prince and Princess de Condé and my father. His Majesty settled the points of
the game at &lsquo;le quart d&rsquo;un sheling.&rsquo; The rest of the party played at billiards or
ombre. The King was so civil as to invite us to sleep there, instead of returning
to the inn at Aylesbury. When he invited us he said, &lsquo;Je crains que vous serez
très-mal logés, mais on donne ce qu&rsquo;on peut.&rsquo; Soon after eleven the King retired,
when we separated for the night. We were certainly &lsquo;très-mal logés.&rsquo; In the
morning when I got out of bed, I was alarmed by the appearance of an old woman
on the leads before my window, who was hanging linen to dry. I was forced to
retreat hastily to bed, not to shock the old lady&rsquo;s modesty. At ten the next
morning we breakfasted, and at eleven we took leave of the King (who always
went to Mass at that hour) and returned to London. We saw the whole place
before we came away; and they certainly had shown great ingenuity in contriving
to lodge such a number of people in and about the house&mdash;it was exactly like a
small rising colony. We were very much pleased with our expedition; and were
invited to return whenever we could make it convenient.</p></div>

fire a shot at the Chancellor about this Bill. He has
written him a letter, in which he has embodied Stephen&rsquo;s
objections and some of his own (as he says, for I did not see
the letter). The Chancellor will be very angry, for he can&rsquo;t
endure contradiction, and he has a prodigious contempt
for the Lord President, whom he calls &lsquo;Mother Elizabeth.&rsquo;
He probably arrives at the sobriquet through Petty, Betty,
and so on.</p>

<p>Dined with Talleyrand yesterday; Pozzo, who said little
and seemed low; Talleyrand <i>talked</i> after dinner, said that
Cardinal Fleury was one of the greatest Ministers who ever
governed France, and that justice had never been done him;
he had maintained peace for twenty years, and acquired
Lorraine for France. He said this <i>à propos</i> of the library he
formed or left, or whatever he did in that line, at Paris. He
told me he goes very often to the British Museum, and has
lately made them a present of a book.</p>

<h3>January 26th, 1833</h3>

<p>It seems that the Government project (or
perhaps only the fact that they have one) about West Indian
emancipation has got wind, and the West Indians are of
course in a state of great alarm. They believe that it will
be announced, whatever it is to be, in the King&rsquo;s Speech,
though I doubt there being anything but a vague intention
expressed in it. Of all political feelings and passions&mdash;and
such this rage for emancipation is, rather than a consideration
of interest&mdash;it has always struck me as the most extraordinary
and remarkable. There can be no doubt that a
great many of the Abolitionists are actuated by very pure
motives; they have been shocked at the cruelties which have
been and still are very often practised towards slaves, their
minds are imbued with the horrors they have read and
heard of, and they have an invincible conviction that the
state of slavery under any form is repugnant to the spirit of
the English Constitution and the Christian religion, and
that it is a stain upon the national character which ought
to be wiped away. These people, generally speaking, are
very ignorant concerning all the various difficulties which
beset the question; their notions are superficial; they pity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the slaves, whom they regard as injured innocents, and they
hate their masters, whom they treat as criminal barbarians.
Others are animated in this cause purely by ambition, and
by finding that it is a capital subject to talk upon, and a
cheap and easy species of benevolence; others have satisfied
themselves that slavery is a mistaken system, that the
cruelty of it is altogether gratuitous, and that free labour
will answer the purpose as well or better, and get rid of the
odium; and thousands more have mixed feelings and
opinions, compounded of some or all of the above in various
degrees and proportions, according to the bent of individual
character; but there are some persons among the most
zealous and able of the Abolitionists who avail themselves
of the passions and the ignorance of the people to carry this
point, while they carefully conceal their own sentiments as
to the result of the experiment. I say some because, though
I only know (of my own knowledge) of one, from the sagacity
of the man and the conformity of his opinions with those of
others on this and other topics, I have no doubt that there
are many who view the matter in the same light. I allude to
Henry
Taylor,<a name="FNA_19_06" id="FNA_19_06"></a><a href="#FN_19_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
who rules half the West Indies in the Colonial
Office, though with an invisible sceptre. Talking over the
matter the other day, he said that he was well aware of the
consequences of emancipation both to the negroes and the
planters. The estates of the latter would not be cultivated;
it would be impossible, for want of labour; the negroes
would not work&mdash;no inducement would be sufficient to make
them; they wanted to be free merely that they might be
idle. They would, on being emancipated, possess themselves
of ground, the fertility of which in those regions is so great
that very trifling labour will be sufficient to provide them
with the means of existence, and they will thus relapse
rapidly into a state of barbarism; they will resume the
habits of their African brethren, but, he thinks, without the
ferocity and savageness which distinguish the latter. Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">HENRY TAYLOR ON ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.</span>
course the germs of civilisation and religion which have
been sown among them in their servile state will be speedily
obliterated; if not, as man must either rise or fall in the
moral scale, they will acquire strength, with it power, and
as certainly the desire of using that power for the amelioration
of their condition. The island (for Jamaica may be
taken for example, as it was in our conversation) would not
long be tenable for whites; indeed, it is difficult to conceive
how any planters could remain there when their property
was no longer cultivable, even though the emancipated
negroes should become as harmless and gentle as the ancient
Mexicans. Notwithstanding this view of the matter, in
which my friend has the sagacity to perceive some of the
probable consequences of the measure, though (he admits)
with much uncertainty as to its operation, influenced as it
must be by circumstances and accidents, he is for emancipating
at once. &lsquo;Fiat justitia ruat c&oelig;lum&rsquo;&mdash;that is, I do
not know that he is for immediate, unconditional emancipation;
I believe not, but he is for doing the deed; whether
he goes before or lags after the Government I do not at
this moment know. He is, too, a high-principled man, full
of moral sensibility and of a grave, reflecting, philosophical
character, and neither a visionary in religion nor in politics,
only of a somewhat austere and uncompromising turn of
mind, and with some of the positiveness of a theorist who
has a lofty opinion of his own capacity, and has never
undergone that discipline of the world, that tumbling and
tossing and jostling, which beget modesty and diffidence and
prudence, from the necessity which they inculcate of constant
compromises with antagonist interests and hostile
passions. But what is the upshot of all this? Why,
that in the midst of the uproar and confusion, the smoke
and the dust of the controversy, one may believe that
one sees a glimmering of the real futurity in the case&mdash;and
that is a long series of troubles and a wide scene of
ruin.</p>

[Afterwards Sir Henry Taylor, K.M.G., author of &lsquo;Philip van Artevelde.&rsquo;
Nearly forty years later Sir H. Taylor continued to fill the same
position described by Mr. Greville in 1833. He resigned in 1872.]</p></div>

<h3>January 30th, 1833</h3>

<p>The intentions of Government with regard
to the West Indies (or rather that they have intentions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
of a nature very fatal to that interest) having got
wind, the consternation of the West India body is great. A
deputation, headed by Sir Alexander Grant, waited upon
Lords Grey and Goderich the other day, and put certain
questions to them, stating that the prevalence of reports,
some of which had appeared in the newspapers, had greatly
alarmed them, and they wished to ascertain if any of them
had been authorised by Government. Lord Grey said
&lsquo;certainly not; the Government had authorised
nothing<ins class="correction" title = "text reads &lsquo;,&rsquo;">.</ins>&rsquo;
They asked if he would reappoint the Committees. He
would give no pledge as to this, but they discussed the
propriety of so doing, he seeming indisposed. To all their
questions he gave vague answers, refusing to communicate
anything except this, that nothing was decided, but a
plan was under the consideration of the Cabinet in which
the interests of all parties were consulted. He added that
he could not pledge himself to give any previous intimation
of the intentions of Government to the West India body,
nor to disclose the measure at all until it was proposed
to Parliament. There are in the meantime no end of reports
of the nature and extent of the proposed measure,
and no end to the projects and opinions of those who are
interested.</p>

<p>I dined at Lord Bathurst&rsquo;s yesterday, and sat next to Lord
Ellenborough, who said that he was convinced the best thing
the proprietors could do would be to agree instantly to stop
their orders, which he believes would compel Government to
arrest their course. I am not enough acquainted with the
subject to judge how far they might operate, but I doubt it,
or that in the temper of the people of this country, or rather
of those zealots who represent it, and with the disposition
of this Government to yield to every popular cry, the fear of
any consequences would prevent their going on. It would,
I believe, only give them and the House of Commons a pretext
for refusing them pecuniary compensation. I was much
amused with a piece of vanity of Ellenborough&rsquo;s. We were
talking of the war between the Turks and the Egyptians,
and the resources of Egypt, &amp;c., when he said, &lsquo;If I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RUSSIA AND TURKEY.</span>
continued at the Board of Control I would have had Egypt,
got at it from the Red Sea; I had already ordered the formation
of <i>a corps</i> of <i>Arab guides</i>!&rsquo;</p>

<h3>February 1st, 1833</h3>

<p>The Reformed Parliament opened heavily
(on Tuesday), as Government think satisfactorily. Cobbett
took his seat on the Treasury Bench, and spoke three times,
though the last time nobody would stay to hear him. He
was very twaddling, and said but one good thing, when he
called O&rsquo;Connell the member for <i>Ireland</i>.</p>

<p>Saw Madame de Lieven the day before yesterday, who fired
a tirade against Government; she vowed that nobody ever had
been treated with such personal incivility as Lieven, &lsquo;des
injures, des reproches,&rsquo; that Cobbett, Hunt, and all the
blackguards in England could not use more offensive language;
whatever event was coming was imputed to Russia&mdash;Belgium,
Portugal, Turkey, &lsquo;tout était la Russie et les
intrigues de la Russie;&rsquo; that she foresaw they should be
driven away from England. With reference to the war
in Asia Minor, she said the Sultan had applied to the
Emperor for assistance, &lsquo;et qu&rsquo;il l&rsquo;aurait, et que le Sultan
n&rsquo;avait pas un meilleur ami que lui,&rsquo; that the Egyptians
would advance no farther, and a great deal more of complaint
at the injustice evinced towards them and on their
political innocence. In the evening I told all this to Mellish
of the Foreign Office, who knows everything about foreign
affairs, and he said it was all a lie, that Russia had offered
her assistance, which the Sultan had refused, and she was, in
fact, intriguing and making mischief in every Court in
Europe. George Villiers writes me word that she has been
for months past endeavouring to get up a war anywhere, and
that this Turkish business is more likely than anything to
bring one about.<a name="FNA_19_07" id="FNA_19_07"></a><a href="#FN_19_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

[The state of the Ottoman Empire was most critical. In the latter
months of 1832 the victorious troops of Mehomet Ali had forced their way
across the Taunus; the peace of Koniah was concluded early in 1833 with
the Egyptians; and the Treaty of Unkiar Skelessi with the Russians in
July 1833.]</p></div>

<h3>February 2nd, 1833</h3>

<p>Dinner at Lord Lansdowne&rsquo;s for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
Sheriffs; soon over and not particularly disagreeable, though
I hate dining with the Ministers; had some conversation with
Goderich about Jamaica; he says Mulgrave has done very well
there, perhaps rather too vigorously, that the dissolution of
the Assembly under all circumstances is questionable, but he
must be supported; he hopes nothing from another assembly,
nor does Mulgrave, who says that they are incorrigible. The
fact is their conduct paralyses the exertions of their friends
here, if, indeed, they have any friends who would make any
exertions.</p>

<h3>February 4th, 1833</h3>

<p>At Court for the King&rsquo;s Speech and the
appointment of Sheriffs. Lord Munster and Lord Denbigh
were sworn Privy Councillors. The West Indians have taken
such an attitude of desperation that the Government is somewhat
alarmed, and seems disposed to pause at the adoption
of its abolitionary measures. George Hibbert told me last
night that if they were driven to extremities there was
nothing they were not ready to do, and that there would be
another panic if Government did not take care, and so
Rothschild had told them.</p>

<p>I dined with Madame de Lieven yesterday, who is in the
agonies of doubt about her remaining here. It turns upon
this: Stratford Canning has been appointed Ambassador at St.
Petersburg, and the Emperor will not receive him. Palmerston
is indignant, and will not send anybody else. If the
Emperor persists, we shall only have a Chargé d&rsquo;Affaires at
his Court, and in that case he will not leave an Ambassador
at ours. There seems to be at present no way out of the
quarrel. Stratford Canning&rsquo;s mission to Madrid cannot last
for ever, and when it is over the point must be decided.</p>

<p>The people of Jamaica have presented a petition to the
King (I don&rsquo;t know exactly in what shape, or how got up),
praying to be released from their allegiance. Goderich told
me that it was very insolent. Mulgrave&rsquo;s recent <i>coup de
théâtre</i> is severely condemned. Nothing can save these
unhappy colonies, for all parties vie with each other in
violence and folly&mdash;the people here and the people there,
the Government here and the Government there.</p>

<h3>February 10th, 1833</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DEBATE ON THE ADDRESS.</span>
After four days&rsquo; debate in the House of
Commons (quite unprecedented, I believe) the Address was
carried by a large
majority.<a name="FNA_19_08" id="FNA_19_08"></a><a href="#FN_19_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
Opinions are of course very
various upon the state of the House and the character of
the discussion. The anti-Reformers, with a sort of melancholy
triumph, boast that their worst expectations have been
fulfilled. The Government were during the first day or two
very serious, and though on the whole they think they have
reason to be satisfied, they cannot help seeing that they
have in fact very little power of managing the House.
Everybody agrees that the aspect of the House of Commons
was very different&mdash;the number of strange faces; the swagger
of O&rsquo;Connell, walking about incessantly, and making signs
to, or talking with, his followers in various parts; the Tories
few and scattered; Peel no longer surrounded with a stout
band of supporters, but pushed from his usual seat, which is
occupied by Cobbett, O&rsquo;Connell, and the Radicals; he is gone
up nearer to the Speaker.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_19_08" id="FN_19_08"></a><a href="#FNA_19_08"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
[The first Reformed Parliament met and was formally opened on the
29th of January, 1833. After the election of the Speaker (Manners Sutton)
the King delivered his Speech from the Throne on the 5th of February.]</p></div>

<p>The whole debate turned upon Ireland. O&rsquo;Connell pronounced
a violent but powerful philippic, which Stanley
answered very well. Macaulay made one of his brilliant
speeches the second night, and Peel spoke the third. It was
not possible to make a more dexterous and judicious speech
than he did; for finding himself in a very uncomfortable
position, he at once placed himself in a good one, and
acknowledging that his situation was altogether different
from what it had been, he contrived to transfer to himself
personally much of the weight and authority which he
previously held as the organ and head of a great and powerful
party. He pronounced an eulogium of Stanley, declared
that his confidence in Government was not augmented, but
that he would support them if they would support law and
order. The Government were extremely pleased at his
speech, though I think not without a secret misgiving that
they are likely to be more in his power than is pleasant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
But the benefit resulting from the whole is that the Radicals
all opposed the Government, while Peel supported them; so
that we may hope that a complete line of separation is
drawn between the two former, and that the Government
will really and boldly take the Conservative side. On the
whole, perhaps, this bout may be deemed satisfactory.</p>

<h3>February 14th, 1833</h3>

<p>The night before last Althorp brought
forward his plan of Irish Church Reform, with complete success.
He did it well, and Stanley made a very brilliant
speech. The House received it with almost unanimous applause,
nobody opposing but Inglis and Goulburn, and Peel,
in a very feeble speech, which scarcely deserves the name of
opposition; it will be of great service to the Government.
O&rsquo;Connell lauded the measure up to the skies; but Sheil said
he would bite his tongue off with vexation the next morning
for having done so, after he had slept upon it. It was clear
that Peel, who is courting the House, and exerting all his
dexterity to bring men&rsquo;s minds round to him, saw the stream
was too strong for him to go against it, so he made a sort of
temporising, moderate, unmeaning speech, which will give
him time to determine on his best course, and did not commit
him. Poulett Thomson said to me yesterday that Peel&rsquo;s
prodigious superiority over everybody in the House was so
evident, his talent for debate and thorough knowledge of
Parliamentary tactics, gained by twenty years of experience,
so commanding, that he must draw men&rsquo;s minds to him, and
that he was evidently playing that game, throwing over the
ultra-Tories and ingratiating himself with the House and
the country. He, in fact, means to open a house to all comers,
and make himself necessary and indispensable. Under that
placid exterior he conceals, I believe, a boundless ambition,
and hatred and jealousy lurk under his professions of esteem
and political attachment. His is one of those contradictory
characters, containing in it so much of mixed good and evil,
that it is difficult to strike an accurate balance between the
two, and the acts of his political life are of a corresponding
description, of questionable utility and merit, though always
marked by great ability. It is very sure that he has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">CHARACTER OF PEEL.</span>
the instrument of great good, or of enormous evil, and apparently
more of the latter. He came into life the child
and champion of a political system which has been for a
long time crumbling to pieces; and if the perils which are
produced by its fall are great, they are mainly attributable
to the manner in which it was upheld by Peel, and to his
want of sagacity, in a wrong estimate of his means of defence
and of the force of the antagonist power with which
he had to contend. The leading principles of his political
conduct have been constantly erroneous, and his dexterity
and ability in supporting them have only made the consequences
of his errors more extensively pernicious. If we
look back through the long course of Peel&rsquo;s life, and enquire
what have been the great political measures with which his
name is particularly connected, we shall find, first, the return
to cash payments, which almost everybody now agrees was
a fatal mistake, though it would not be fair to visit him with
extraordinary censure for a measure which was sanctioned
by almost all the great financial authorities; secondly, opposition
to Reform in Parliament and to religious emancipation
of every kind, the maintenance of the exclusive system,
and support, untouched and unconnected, of the Church, both
English and Irish. His resistance to alterations on these
heads was conducted with great ability, and for a long time
with success; but he was endeavouring to uphold a system
which was no longer supportable, and having imbibed in his
career much of the liberal spirit of the age, he found himself
in a state of no small perplexity between his old connections
and his more enlarged propensities. Still he was chained
down by the former, and consequently being beaten from all
his positions, he was continually obliged to give way, but
never did so till rather too late for his own credit and much
too late for the interest at stake. Notwithstanding, therefore,
the reputation he has acquired, the hold he has had of
office, and is probably destined to have again, his political
life has been a considerable failure, though not such an one
as to render it more probable than not that his future life
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
will be a failure too. He has hitherto been encumbered with
embarrassing questions and an unmanageable party. Time
has disposed of the first, and he is divorced from the last;
if his great experience and talents have a fair field to act
upon, he may yet, in spite of his selfish and unamiable character,
be a distinguished and successful Minister.</p>

<h3>February 16th, 1833</h3>

<p>Madame de Lieven gave me an account
(the day before yesterday) of the quarrel between the two
Courts about Stratford Canning. When the present Ministry
came in, Nesselrode wrote to Madame de Lieven and desired
her to beg that Lord Heytesbury might be left there&mdash;&lsquo;Conservez-nous
Heytesbury.&rsquo; She asked Palmerston and Lord
Grey, and they both promised her he should stay. Some
time after he asked to be recalled. She wrote word to
Nesselrode, and told him that either Adair or Canning would
succeed him. He replied, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t let it be Canning; he is
a most impracticable man, <i>soupçonneux, pointilleux, défiant</i>;&rsquo;
that he had been personally uncivil to the Emperor when he
was Grand Duke; in short the plain truth was they would
not receive him, and it was therefore desirable somebody,
anybody, else should be sent. She told this to Palmerston,
and he engaged that Stratford Canning should not be named.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
Nothing more was done till some time ago, when to her astonishment
Palmerston told her that he was going to send
Canning to St. Petersburg. She remonstrated, urged all the
objections of her Court, his own engagement, but in vain; the
discussions between them grew bitter; Palmerston would not
give way, and Canning was one day to her horror gazetted.
As might have been expected, Nesselrode positively refused
to receive him. Durham, who in the meantime had been to
Russia and <i>bien comblé</i> with civilities, promised that Canning
should not go there, trusting he had sufficient influence to
prevent it; and since he has been at home it is one of the
things he has been most violent and bitter about, because
Palmerston will not retract this nomination, and he has the
mortification of finding in this instance his own want of power.
However, as there have been no discussions on it lately, the
Princess still hopes it may blow over, and that some other
mission may be found for Canning. At all events it appears
a most curious piece of diplomacy to insist upon thrusting
upon a Court a man personally obnoxious to the Sovereign
and his Minister, and not the best way of preserving harmonious
relations or obtaining political advantages. She
says, however (and with all her anger she is no bad judge),
that Palmerston &lsquo;est un très-petit esprit&mdash;lourd, obstiné,&rsquo;
&amp;c., and she is astonished how Lady C. with her <i>finesse</i> can
be so taken with him.</p>

<p>Lady Cowper has since told me that Madame de Lieven
has been to blame in all this business, that Palmerston was
provoked with her interference, that her temper had got the
better of her, and she had thought to carry it with a high
hand, having been used to have her own way, and that he
had thought both <i>she</i> and her <i>Court</i> wanted to be taken down
a peg; that she had told Nesselrode she could prevent this
appointment, and, what had done more harm than anything,
she had appealed to Grey against Palmerston, and employed
Durham to make a great clamour about it. All this made
Palmerston angry, and determined him to punish her, who
he thought had meddled more than she ought, and had made
the matter personally embarrassing and disagreeable to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD GREY&rsquo;S COERCION BILL.</span>
Last night Lord Grey introduced his coercive measures
in an excellent speech, though there are some people who
doubt his being able to carry them through the House of
Commons. If he can&rsquo;t, he goes of course; and what next?
The measures are sufficiently strong, it must be owned&mdash;a
<i>consommé</i> of insurrection-gagging Acts, suspension of Habeas
Corpus, martial law, and one or two other little hards and
sharps.<a name="FNA_20_01" id="FNA_20_01"></a><a href="#FN_20_01" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_20_01" id="FN_20_01"></a><a href="#FNA_20_01"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
[In the debate on the Address O&rsquo;Connell had denounced the coercive
measures announced in the Speech from the Throne as &lsquo;brutal, bloody, and
unconstitutional.&rsquo; But the state of Ireland was so dreadful that it demanded
and justified the severest remedies. Lord Grey stated in the House
of Lords that between January 1st and December 31st 9,000 crimes had
been committed&mdash;homicides 242, robberies 1,179, burglaries 401, burnings
568, and so on. The Bill gave the Lord-Lieutenant power to proclaim
disturbed districts, to substitute courts-martial for the ordinary courts of
justice, to prohibit meetings, and to punish the distributors of seditious
papers. Such were the powers which Lord Wellesley described as more
formidable to himself than to the people of Ireland, for the greater part of
them were never exercised. The Act produced the desired effect. In a
year Ireland was pacified; and the abandonment of several of the most
important clauses in the Act (contrary to Lord Grey&rsquo;s wishes) was the
cause which led to the dissolution of the Ministry in the month of June
1834.]</p></div>

<h3>London, February 22nd, 1833</h3>

<p>Dined yesterday with Fortunatus
Dwarris, who was counsel to the Board of Health; one of
those dinners that people in that class of society put themselves
in an agony to give, and generally their guests in
as great an agony to partake of. There were Goulburn,
Serjeant ditto and his wife, Stephen, &amp;c. Goulburn mentioned
a curious thing <i>à propos</i> of slavery. A slave ran away
from his estate in Jamaica many years ago, and got to
England. He (the man) called at his house when he was not
at home, and Goulburn never could afterwards find out where
he was. He remained in England, however, gaining his livelihood
by some means, till after some years he returned to
Jamaica and to the estate, and desired to be employed as a
slave again.</p>

<p>Stephen, who is one of the great apostles of emancipation,
and who resigned a profession worth 3,000&#8467;. a year at the
Bar for a place of 1,500&#8467;. in the Colonial Office, principally in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
order to advance that object, owned that he had never known
so great a problem nor so difficult a question to settle. His
notion is that compulsory labour may be substituted for
slavery, and in some colonies (the new ones, as they are
called&mdash;Demerara, &amp;c.) he thinks it will not be difficult; in
Jamaica he is doubtful, and admits that if this does not
answer the slaves will relapse into barbarism, nor is he at
all clear that <i>any</i> disorders and evils may not be produced
by the effect of desperation on one side and disappointment
on the other; still he does not hesitate to go on, but fully
admitting the right of the proprietors to ample compensation,
and the duty incumbent on the country to give it. If the
sentiments of justice and benevolence with which he is
actuated were common to all who profess the same opinions,
or if the same sagacity and resource which he possesses were
likely to be applied to the practical operation of the scheme,
the evils which are dreaded and foreseen might be mitigated
and avoided; but this is very far from the case, and the
evils will, in all probability, more than overbalance the good
which humanity aims at effecting; nor is it possible to view
the settlement (as it is called, for all changes are settlements
now-a-days) of this question without a misgiving that it will
only produce some other great topic for public agitation,
some great interest to be overturned or mighty change to
be accomplished. The public appetite for discussion and
legislation has been whetted and is insatiable; the millions
of orators and legislators who have sprung up like mushrooms
all over the kingdom, the bellowers, the chatterers, the
knaves, and the dupes, who make such an universal hubbub,
must be fed with fresh victims and sacrifices. The Catholic
question was speedily followed by Reform in Parliament, and
this has opened a door to anything.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Reformed Parliament has been
sitting for a fortnight or so, and begins to manifest its
character and pretensions. The first thing that strikes one
is its inferiority in point of composition to preceding
Houses of Commons, and the presumption, impertinence,
and self-sufficiency of the new members. Formerly new
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ASPECT OF THE NEW HOUSE OF COMMONS.</span>
members appeared with some modesty and diffidence, and
with some appearance of respect for the assembly into which
they were admitted; these fellows behave themselves as if
they had taken it by storm, and might riot in all the insolence
of victory. There exists no <i>party</i> but that of the
Government; the Irish act in a body under O&rsquo;Connell to the
number of about forty; the Radicals are scattered up and
down without a leader, numerous, restless, turbulent, and
bold&mdash;Hume, Cobbett, and a multitude such as Roebuck,
Faithfull, Buckingham, Major Beauclerck, &amp;c. (most of
whom have totally failed in point of speaking)&mdash;bent upon
doing all the mischief they can and incessantly active; the
Tories without a head, frightened, angry, and sulky; Peel
without a party, prudent, cautious, and dexterous, playing a
deep waiting game of scrutiny and observation. The feelings
of these various elements of party, rather than parties,
may be thus summed up:&mdash;The Radicals are confident and
sanguine; the Whigs uneasy; the Tories desponding; moderate
men, who belong to no party, but support Government,
serious, and not without alarm. There is, in fact, enough
to justify alarm, for the Government has evidently no power
over the House of Commons, and though it is probable that
they will scramble through the session without sustaining
any serious defeat, or being reduced to the necessity of any
great sacrifice or compromise, they are conscious of their
own want of authority and of that sort of command without
which no Government has been hitherto deemed secure.
The evil of this is that we are now reduced to the alternative
of Lord Grey&rsquo;s Government or none at all; and should
he be defeated on any great measure, he must either abandon
the country to its fate, or consent to carry on the
Government upon the condition of a virtual transfer of the
executive power to the House of Commons. If this comes
to pass the game is up, for this House, like animals who
have once tasted blood, if it ever exercises such a power as
this, and finds a Minister consenting to hold office on such
terms, will never rest till it has acquired all the authority of
the Long Parliament and reduced that of the Crown to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
mere cypher. It is curious, by-the-bye, that the example of
the Long Parliament in a trivial matter has just been adopted,
in the sittings of the House at twelve o&rsquo;clock for the hearing
of petitions.</p>

<h3>February 27th, 1833</h3>

<p>Laid up ever since that dinner at
Dwarris&rsquo;s with the gout. Frederick Fitzclarence has been
compelled to resign the situation at the Tower which the
King gave him; they found it very probable that the House
of Commons would refuse to vote the pay of it&mdash;a trifle in
itself, but indicative of the spirit of the times and the total
want of consideration for the King. O&rsquo;Connell made a
speech of such violence at the Trades Union the other day&mdash;calling
the House of Commons six hundred scoundrels&mdash;that
there was a great deal of talk about taking it up in Parliament
and proposing his expulsion, which, however, they
have not had the folly to do. The Irish Bill was to come on
last night. The sense of insecurity and uneasiness evidently
increases; the Government assumes a high tone, but is not
at all certain of its ability to pass the Coercive Bills unaltered,
and yesterday there appeared an article in the &lsquo;Times&rsquo; in a
style of lofty reproof and severe admonition, which was no
doubt as appalling as it was meant to be. This article
made what is called a great sensation; always struggling,
as this paper does, to take the lead of public opinion and
watching all its turns and shifts with perpetual anxiety, it is
at once regarded as undoubted evidence of its direction and
dreaded for the influence which its powerful writing and
extensive sale have placed in its hands. It is no small
homage to the power of the press to see that an article like
this makes as much noise as the declaration of a powerful
Minister or a leader of Opposition could do in either House
of Parliament.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning the Duke of Wellington came here
upon some private business, after discussing which he entered
upon the state of the country. I told him my view of the
condition of the Government and of the House of Commons,
and he said, &lsquo;You have hit the two points that I have
myself always felt so strongly about. I told Lord Grey so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">DUKE OF WELLINGTON&rsquo;S VIEW OF AFFAIRS.</span>
long ago, and asked him at the time how he expected to be
able to carry on the Government of the country, to which he
never could give any answer, except that it would all do very
well. However, things are not a bit worse than I always
thought they would be. As they are, I mean to support the
Government&mdash;support them in every way. The first thing I
have to look to is to keep my house over my head, and the
alternative is between this Government and none at all. I
am therefore for supporting the Government, but then there
is so much passion, and prejudice, and folly, and vindictive
feeling, that it is very difficult to get others to do the same.
I hear Peel had only fifty people with him the other night
on some question, though they say that there are 150 of
that party in the House of Commons. He thinks as ill of
the whole thing as possible. [While I am writing Poodle
Byng is come in, who tells me what happened last night.
Althorp made a very bad speech and a wretched statement;
other people spoke, pert and disagreeable, and the debate
looked ill till Stanley rose and made one of the finest
speeches that were ever heard, pounding O&rsquo;Connell to dust
and attacking him for his &lsquo;six hundred scoundrels,&rsquo; from
which he endeavoured to escape by a miserable and abortive
explanation. Stanley seems to have set the whole thing to
rights, like a great man.]</p>

<p>I told the Duke what Macaulay had said to Denison: &lsquo;that
if he had had to legislate, he would, instead of this Bill, have
suspended the laws for five years in Ireland, given the Lord-Lieutenant&rsquo;s
proclamation the force of law, and got the
Duke of Wellington to go there.&rsquo; He seemed very well
pleased at this, and said, &lsquo;Well, that is the way I governed
the provinces on the Garonne in the south of France. I
desired the mayors to go on administering the law of the
land, and when they asked me in whose name criminal suits
should be carried on (which were ordinarily in the name of
the Emperor), and if they should be in the name of the
King, I said no, that we were treating with the Emperor at
Chatillon, and if they put forth the King they would be in
a scrape; neither should it be in the Emperor&rsquo;s name, because
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
we did not acknowledge him, but in that of the
Allied Powers.&rsquo; In this I think he was wrong (<i>par parenthèse</i>),
for Napoleon was acknowledged by all the Powers
but us, and we were treating with him, and if he permitted
the civil authorities to administer the law as usual, he should
have allowed them to administer it in the usual legal form.
Their civil administration could not affect any political
questions in the slightest degree.</p>

<h3>March 4th, 1833</h3>

<p>Sir Thomas Hardy told my brother he
thought the King would certainly go mad; he was so excitable,
<i>loathing</i> his Ministers, particularly Graham, and dying
to go to war. He has some of the cunning of madmen, who
fawn upon their keepers when looked at by them, and grin
at them and shake their fists when their backs are turned;
so he is extravagantly civil when his Ministers are with him,
and exhibits every mark of aversion when they are away.
Peel made an admirable speech on Friday night; they
expect a great majority.</p>

<h3>March 13th, 1833</h3>

<p>The second reading of the Coercive Bill has
passed by a great majority after a dull debate, and the other
night Althorp deeply offended Peel and the Tories by hurrying
on the Church Reform Bill. It was to be printed one day,
and the second reading taken two days after. They asked
a delay of four or five days, and Althorp refused. He did
very wrong; he is either bullied or cajoled into almost anything
the Radicals want of this sort, but he is stout against
the Tories. The delay is required by decency, but it ought
to have been enough that Peel and the others asked it for
him to concede it. He ought to soften the asperities which
must long survive the battles of last year as much as he can,
and avoid shocking what he may consider the prejudices of
the vanquished party. It was worse than impolitic; it was
stupid and uncourteous, and missing an opportunity of being
gracious which he ought to have seized.</p>

<p>I have been again worried with a new edition of
Brougham&rsquo;s Privy Council
Bill,<a name="FNA_20_02" id="FNA_20_02"></a><a href="#FN_20_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and the difficulty of getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD BROUGHAM&rsquo;S PRIVY COUNCIL BILL.</span>
Lord Lansdowne to <i>do</i> anything. This is the way Brougham
goes to work:&mdash;He resolves to alter; he does not condescend
to communicate with the Privy Council, or to consult those
who are conversant with its practice, or who have been in
the habit of administering justice there; he has not time to
think of it himself; he tosses to one of his numerous <i>employés</i>
(for he has people without end working for him) his rough
notion, and tells him to put it into shape; the satellite goes
to work, always keeping in view the increase of the dignity,
authority, and patronage of the Chancellor, and careless of
the Council, the King, and the usages of the Constitution.
What is called <i>the Bill</i> is then, for form&rsquo;s sake, handed over
to the Lord President (Lord Lansdowne), with injunctions to
let nobody see it, as if he was conspiring against the Council,
secure that if he meets with no resistance but what is
engendered by Lord Lansdowne&rsquo;s opposition he may enact
anything he pleases. Lord Lansdowne sends it to me (a
long Act of Parliament), with a request that I will return it
&lsquo;<i>by the bearer</i>,&rsquo; with any remarks I may have to make on it.
The end is that I am left, <i>quantum impar</i>, to fight this with
the Chancellor.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_20_02" id="FN_20_02"></a><a href="#FNA_20_02"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
[This was the Bill for the establishment of a Judicial Committee of the
Privy Council, which eventually became the Act 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV., cap. 41, and
definitively created that tribunal. Mr. Greville objected to several of the
provisions of the measure, because he regarded them as an unnecessary
interference of Parliament with the authority of the Sovereign in his
Council. The Sovereign might undoubtedly have created a Committee of
the judicial members of the Privy Council: but the Bill went further, and
by extending and defining the power of the Judicial Committee as a Court
of Appeal it undoubtedly proved a very useful and important measure.]</p></div>

<h3>March 15th, 1833</h3>

<p>Ministerial changes are going on; Durham
is out, and to be made an earl. Yesterday his elevation was
known, and it is amusing enough that the same day an
incident should have occurred in the House of Lords exhibiting
in a good light the worthiness of the subject, and how
much he merits it at the hands of Lord Grey.</p>

<hr />

<h3>March 29th, 1833</h3>

<p>Lord Goderich is Privy
Seal,<a name="FNA_20_03" id="FNA_20_03"></a><a href="#FN_20_03" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and Stanley
Secretary for the Colonies, after much trouble. Last year a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
positive pledge was given to Stanley that he should not
meet Parliament again but as Secretary of State. It was
not, however, specified who was to make room for him.
The Cabinet settled that it should be Goderich, when
Durham went out, and Palmerston was charged with the
office of breaking it to Goderich with the offer of an earldom
by way of gilding the pill, but Goderich would not hear of
it, said it would look like running away from the Slave
question, and, in short, flatly refused. Stanley threatened to
resign if he was not promoted, and in this dilemma the Duke
of Richmond (who was going to Windsor) persuaded Lord
Grey to let him lay the case before the King, and inform him
that if this arrangement was not made the Government must
be broken up. He did so, and the King acquiesced, and at
the same time a similar representation was made to Goderich,
who after a desperate resistance knocked under, and said
that if it must be so he would yield, but <i>only</i> to the King&rsquo;s
express commands.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_20_03" id="FN_20_03"></a><a href="#FNA_20_03"><span class="label">[3]</span></a>
[Down to this time Lord Goderich had been Secretary for the Colonial
Department in Lord Grey&rsquo;s Government.]</p></div>

<h3>March 30th, 1833</h3>

<p>Saw Madame de Lieven yesterday, who
told me the story of the late business at St. Petersburg. The
Sultan after the battle of Koniah applied to the Emperor of
Russia for succour, who ordered twelve sail of the line and
30,000 men to go to the protection of Constantinople. At
the same time General Mouravieff was sent to Constantinople,
with orders to proceed to Alexandria and inform the Pacha
that the Emperor could only look upon him as a rebel, that
he would not suffer the Ottoman Empire to be overturned,
and that if Ibrahim advanced &lsquo;il aurait affaire à l&rsquo;Empereur
de Russie.&rsquo; Orders were accordingly sent to Ibrahim to
suspend his operations, and Mouravieff returned to Constantinople.
Upon the demand for succour by the Sultan, and
the Emperor&rsquo;s compliance with it, notification was made
to all the Courts, and instructions were given to the
Russian commanders to retire as soon as the Sultan should
have no further occasion for their aid. So satisfactory was
this that Lord Grey expressed the greatest anxiety that the
Russian armament should arrive in time to arrest the progress
of the Egyptians. They did arrive&mdash;at least the fleet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">PRECARIOUS STATE OF THE GOVERNMENT.</span>
did&mdash;and dropped anchor under the Seraglio. At this juncture
arrived Admiral Roussin in a ship of war, and as
Ambassador of France. He immediately informed the
Sultan that the interposition of Russia was superfluous, that
he would undertake to conclude a treaty, and to answer for
the acquiescence of the Pacha, and he sent a project one
article of which was that the Russian fleet should instantly
withdraw. To this proposition the Sultan acceded, and
without waiting for the Pacha&rsquo;s confirmation he notified to
the Russian Ambassador that he had no longer any wish
for the presence of the Russian fleet, and they accordingly
weighed anchor and sailed away. This is all that is known
of the transaction, but Madame de Lieven was loud and vehement
about the insolence of Roussin; she said the Emperor
would demand &lsquo;une satisfaction éclatante&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;le rappel et le
désaveu de l&rsquo;amiral Roussin,&rsquo; and that if this should be refused
the Russian Ambassador would be ordered to quit Paris.
She waits with great anxiety to see the end of the business,
for on it appears to depend the question of peace or war
with France. She said that the day before Namik went away
intelligence of this event arrived, which Palmerston communicated
to him. The Turk heard it very quietly, and then
only said, &lsquo;Et où était l&rsquo;Angleterre dans tout ceci?&rsquo;</p>

<p>I have heard to-night the Goderich version of his late
translation. He had agreed to remain in the Cabinet without
an office, but Lord Grey insisted on his taking the Privy
Seal, and threatened to resign if he did not; he was at
last <i>bullied</i> into acquiescence, and when he had his audience
of the King his Majesty offered him anything he had to
give. He said he had made the sacrifice to please and serve
him, and would take nothing. An earldom&mdash;he refused;
the Bath&mdash;ditto; <i>the Garter</i>&mdash;that he said he would take.
It was then discovered that he was not of rank sufficient,
when he said he would take the earldom in order to qualify
himself for the Garter, and so it stands. There is no Garter
vacant, and one supernumerary already, and Castlereagh
and Lord North, viscounts, and Sir Robert Walpole (all
Commoners) had blue ribands!</p>

<h3>London, April 28th, 1833</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Came to town last night from Newmarket,
and the intervening week at Buckenham. Nothing
but racing and hawking; a wretched life&mdash;that is, a life of
amusement, but very unprofitable and discreditable to anybody
who can do better things. Of politics I know nothing
during this interval, but on coming to town find all in confusion,
and everybody gaping for &lsquo;what next.&rsquo; Government
was beaten on the Malt Tax, and Lord Grey proposed to resign;
the Tories are glad that the Government is embarrassed,
no matter how, the supporters sorry and repentant, so that
it is very clear the matter will be patched up; they won&rsquo;t
budge, and will probably get more regular support for the
future. Perhaps Althorp will go, but where to find a
Chancellor of the Exchequer will be the difficulty. Poulett
Thomson wants it, but they will not dare commit the
finances of the country to him, so we go scrambling on &lsquo;du
jour la journée.&rsquo; Nobody knows what is to happen next&mdash;no
confidence, no security, great talk of a property tax, to
which, I suppose, after wriggling about, we shall at last come.</p>

<h3>May 2nd, 1833</h3>

<p>The Government affair is patched up, and
nobody goes but
Hobhouse,<a name="FNA_20_04" id="FNA_20_04"></a><a href="#FN_20_04" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
who thought fit to resign both
his seat in Parliament and his office, thereby creating another
great embarrassment, which can only be removed by his
re-election and re-appointment, and then, what a farce!</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_20_04" id="FN_20_04"></a><a href="#FNA_20_04"><span class="label">[4]</span></a>
[Sir John Hobhouse, who had consented to take the Irish Secretaryship
a month before, resigned now because he felt unable to oppose a
resolution for the abolition of the window duties; and resigning office he
resigned his seat for Westminster also, and was not re-elected. See in the
&lsquo;Edinburgh Review,&rsquo; April 1871 (No. 272), an account of this transaction.]</p></div>

<p>There were two great majorities in the House of Commons
the night before last. The King was all graciousness and
favour to Lord Grey, and so they are set up again, and fancy
themselves stronger than before. But although everybody
(except the fools) wished them to be re-established, it was
evident that this was only because, at this moment, the time
is not ripe for a change, for they inspired no interest either
individually or collectively. It was easy to see that the
Government has no consideration, and that people are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">EMBARRASSMENT OF THE GOVERNMENT.</span>
getting tired of their blunders and embarrassments, and
begin to turn their eyes to those who are more capable, and
know something of the business of Government&mdash;to Peel and
to Stanley, for the former, in spite of his cold, calculating
selfishness and duplicity, is the ablest man there is, and we
must take what we can get, and accept services without
troubling ourselves about the motives of those who supply
them. It must come to this conclusion unless the reign of
Radicalism and the authority of the Humes &lsquo;et hoc genus
omne&rsquo; is to be substituted. That the present Government
loses ground every day is perfectly clear, and at the same
time that the fruits of the Reform Bill become more lamentably
apparent. The scrape Government lately got into was
owing partly to the votes that people were obliged to give to
curry favour with their constituents, and partly to negligence
and carelessness in whipping in. Hobhouse&rsquo;s resignation is
on account of his pledges, and because he is forced to pledge
himself on the hustings he finds himself placed in a situation
which compels him to save his honour and consistency by
embarrassing the public service to the greatest degree at a
very critical time. Men go on asking one another how is it
possible the country can be governed in this manner, and
nobody can reply.</p>

<p>Since I have been out of town the appeal against the
Chancellor&rsquo;s judgment in the Drax (lunacy) case has been
heard at the Privy Council, and will be finally determined on
Saturday.<a name="FNA_20_05" id="FNA_20_05"></a><a href="#FN_20_05" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
Two years have nearly elapsed since that case
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
was lodged, and the Chancellor has always found pretexts
for getting the hearing postponed; at length the parties
became so clamorous that it was necessary to fix a day. He
then endeavoured to pack a committee, and spoke to Lord
Lansdowne about summoning Lord Plunket, Lord Lyndhurst,
and the Vice-Chancellor, but Leach, who hates Brougham,
and is particularly nettled at his having reversed some of his
judgments, bestirred himself, and represented to Lord Lansdowne
the absolute necessity (in a case of such consequence)
of having all the ex-Chancellors to hear it. Plunket was
gone to Ireland, so the Committee consisted of the Lord
President, the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, Master of the
Rolls, Lords Eldon, Lyndhurst, and Manners. They say the
argument was very able&mdash;Sugden in support of the Chancellor&rsquo;s
judgment, and Pemberton against it; they expect it
will be reversed. Leach, foolishly enough, by question and
observation, exhibited a strong bias against the Chancellor,
who never said a word, and appeared very calm and easy,
but with rage in his heart, for he was indignant at these
Lords having been summoned (as his secretary told
Lennard<a name="FNA_20_06" id="FNA_20_06"></a><a href="#FN_20_06" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>),
and said &lsquo;he was sure it was all Leach&rsquo;s doing.&rsquo; What a
man! how wonderful! how despicable! carrying into the
administration of justice the petty vanity, personal jealousy
and pique, and shuffling arts that would reflect ridicule and
odium on a silly woman of fashion. He has smuggled his
Privy Council Bill through the House of Lords without the
slightest notice or remark.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_20_05" id="FN_20_05"></a><a href="#FNA_20_05"><span class="label">[5]</span></a>
[An appeal lies to the King in Council from orders of the Lord
Chancellor in lunacy, but there are very few examples of the prosecution
of appeals of this nature. This case of Drax <i>v.</i> Grosvenor, which is reported
in &lsquo;Knapp&rsquo;s Privy Council Cases,&rsquo; was therefore one of great
peculiarity. The Bill constituting the Judicial Committee had not at this
time become law; this appeal was therefore heard by a Committee of the
Lords of the Council, to which any member of the Privy Council might be
summoned. Care was taken that the highest legal authorities should be
present. It was the last time Lord Eldon sat in a court of law. Lord
Brougham, the Chancellor, sat on the Committee, although the appeal was
brought from an order made by himself: this practice had not been uncommon
in the House of Lords, but it had not been the practice of the
Privy Council, where indeed the case could seldom arise.]</p></div>

<h3>May 16th, 1833</h3>

<p>On coming to town found the Westminster
election just over, and Evans returned. They would not
hear Hobhouse, and pelted him and his friends. No
Secretary for Ireland is to be found, for the man must be
competent, and sure of re-election. Few are the first and
none the last. Hobhouse is generally censured for having
put Government in this great difficulty, but the Tories see it
all with a sort of grim satisfaction, and point at it as a happy
illustration of the benefits of the Reform Bill. I point too,
but I don&rsquo;t rejoice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">SLAVE EMANCIPATION.</span>
At the same time with Hobhouse&rsquo;s defeat came forth
Stanley&rsquo;s plan for slave emancipation, which produced rage
and fury among both West Indians and Saints, being too
much for the former and not enough for the latter, and both
announced their opposition to it. Practical men declare
that it is impossible to carry it into effect, and that the
details are unmanageable. Even the Government adherents
do not pretend that it is a good and safe measure, but the
best that could be hit off under the circumstances; these
circumstances being the old motive, &lsquo;the people will have it.&rsquo;
The night before last Stanley developed his plan in the
House of Commons in a speech of three hours, which was
very eloquent, but rather disappointing. He handled the
preliminary topics of horrors of slavery and colonial obstinacy
and misconduct with all the vigour and success that might
have been expected, but when he came to his measure he
failed to show how it was to be put in operation and to work.
The peroration and eulogy on Wilberforce were very brilliant.
Howick had previously announced his intention of opposing
Stanley, and accordingly he did so in a speech of considerable
vehemence which lasted two hours. He was not, however,
well received; his father and mother had in vain
endeavoured to divert him from his resolution; but though
they say his speech was clever, he has damaged himself by
it. His plan is immediate
emancipation.<a name="FNA_20_07" id="FNA_20_07"></a><a href="#FN_20_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_20_07" id="FN_20_07"></a><a href="#FNA_20_07"><span class="label">[7]</span></a>
[The result proved that Lord Howick was right. The apprenticeship
system proposed by Lord Stanley was carried, but failed in execution, and
was eventually abandoned.]</p></div>

<p>While such is the state of things here&mdash;enormous interests
under discussion, great disquietude and alarm, no feeling of
security, no confidence in the Government, and a Parliament
that inspires fear rather than hope&mdash;matters abroad seem to
be no better managed than they are at home. It is remarkable
that the business in the East has escaped with so little
animadversion, for there never was a fairer object of attack.
While France has been vapouring, and we have been doing
nothing at all, Russia has established her own influence in
Turkey, and made herself virtually mistress of the Ottoman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
Empire. At a time when our interests required that we
should be well represented, and powerfully supported, we
had neither an Ambassador nor a fleet in the Mediterranean;
and because Lord Ponsonby is Lord Grey&rsquo;s brother-in-law
he has been able with impunity to dawdle on months after
months at Naples for his pleasure, and leave affairs at
Constantinople to be managed or mismanaged by a Chargé
d&rsquo;Affaires who is altogether incompetent.</p>

<h3>May 19th, 1833</h3>

<p>They have found a Secretary for Ireland in
the person of
Littleton,<a name="FNA_20_08" id="FNA_20_08"></a><a href="#FN_20_08" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
which shows to what shifts they
are put. He is rich, which is his only qualification, being
neither very able nor very popular. The West India question
is postponed. The Duke of Wellington told me that he
thought it would pass away for this time, and that all parties
would be convinced of the impracticability of any of the plans
now mooted. I said that nothing could do away the mischief
that had been done by broaching it. He thought &lsquo;the
mischief might be avoided;&rsquo; but then these people do nothing
to avoid any mischief. I was marvellously struck (we rode
together through St. James&rsquo;s Park) with the profound respect
with which the Duke was treated, everybody we met
taking off their hats to him, everybody in the park rising as
he went by, and every appearance of his inspiring great
reverence. I like this symptom, and it is the more remarkable
because it is not <i>popularity</i>, but a much higher feeling
towards him. He has forfeited his popularity more than
once; he has taken a line in politics directly counter to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">RESPECT SHOWN TO WELLINGTON.</span>
popular bias; but though in moments of excitement he is
attacked and vilified (and his broken windows, which I wish
he would mend, still preserve a record of the violence of the
mob), when the excitement subsides there is always a returning
sentiment of admiration and respect for him, kept
alive by the recollection of his splendid actions, such as no
one else ever inspired. Much, too, as I have regretted and
censured the enormous errors of his political career (at
times), I believe that this sentiment is in a great degree produced
by the justice which is done to his political character,
sometimes mistaken, but always high-minded and patriotic,
and never mean, false, or selfish. If he has aimed at power,
and overrated his own capacity for wielding it, it has been
with the purest intentions and the most conscientious views.
I believe firmly that no man had ever at heart to a greater
degree the honour and glory of his country; and hereafter,
when justice will be done to his memory, and his character
and conduct be scanned with impartial eyes, if his capacity
for government appears unequal to the exigencies of the
times in which he was placed at the head of affairs, the
purity of his motives and the noble character of his ambition
will be amply acknowledged.</p>

[The Rt. Hon. E. J. Littleton, M.P. for Staffordshire, and afterwards
first Lord Hatherton.</p>

<p>It was Lord John Russell who advised Lord Grey to make Littleton
Irish Secretary. He told me so in May 1871, but added, &lsquo;I think I made
a mistake.&rsquo; The appointment was wholly unsolicited and unexpected by
Mr. Littleton himself, who happened to be laid up at the time by an
accident. On the receipt of the letter from Lord Grey offering him the
Secretaryship of Ireland, and requesting him to take it, Mr. Littleton
consulted Mr. Fazakerly, who was of opinion that he ought to accept the
offer. This therefore he did, though not, as I know from his own journals,
without great diffidence and hesitation; and he intimated to Lord Grey
that he would only retain his office until some other man could be found to
accept it.]</p></div>

<p>The Duke of Orleans is here, and very well received by
the Court and the world. He is good-looking, dull, has good
manners and little conversation, goes everywhere, and dances
all night. At the ball at Court the Queen waltzed with the
two Dukes of Orleans and Brunswick.</p>

<p>Peel compelled old Cobbett to bring on his motion for
getting him erased from the Privy Council, which Cobbett
wished to shirk from. He gave him a terrible dressing, and it
all went off for Peel in the most flattering way. He gains every
day more authority and influence in the House of Commons.
It must end in Peel and Stanley, unless everything ends.</p>

<h3>May 27th, 1833</h3>

<p>All last week at Epsom, and now, thank God,
these races are over. I have had all the trouble and excitement
and worry, and have neither won nor lost; nothing but
the hope of gain would induce me to go through this demoralising
drudgery, which I am conscious reduces me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the level of all that is most disreputable and despicable, for
my thoughts are eternally absorbed by it. Jockeys, trainers,
and blacklegs are my companions, and it is like dram-drinking;
having once entered upon it I cannot leave it off, though
I am disgusted with the occupation all the time. Let no
man who has no need, who is not in danger of losing all he
has, and is not obliged to grasp at every chance, <i>make a book</i>
on the Derby. While the fever it excites is raging, and the
odds are varying, I can neither read, nor write, nor occupy myself
with anything else. I went to the Oaks on Wednesday,
where Lord Stanley kept house for the first, and probably (as
the house is for sale) for the last time. It is a very agreeable
place, with an odd sort of house built at different times and
by different people; but the outside is covered with ivy and
creepers, which is pretty, and there are two good living-rooms
in it. Besides this, there is an abundance of grass
and shade; it has been for thirty or forty years the resort
of all our old jockeys, and is now occupied by the sporting
portion of the Government. We had Lord Grey and his
daughter, Duke and Duchess of Richmond, Lord and Lady
Errol, Althorp, Graham, Uxbridge, Charles Grey, Duke of
Grafton, Lichfield, and Stanley&rsquo;s brothers. It passed off very
well&mdash;racing all the morning, an excellent dinner, and whist
and blind hookey in the evening. It was curious to see
Stanley. Who would believe they beheld the orator and
statesman, only second, if second, to Peel in the House of
Commons, and on whom the destiny of the country perhaps
depends? There he was, as if he had no thoughts but for the
turf, full of the horses, interest in the lottery, eager, blunt,
noisy, good-humoured, &lsquo;has meditans nugas et <i>totus in illis</i>;&rsquo;
at night equally devoted to the play, as if his fortune depended
on it. Thus can a man relax whose existence is devoted to
great objects and serious thoughts. I had considerable hopes
of winning the Derby, but was beaten easily, my horse not
being good. An odd circumstance occurred to me before the
race. Payne told me in strict confidence that a man who
could not appear on account of his debts, and who had been,
much connected with turf robberies, came to him, and entreated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">ANECDOTE OF THE DERBY.</span>
him to take the odds for him to 1,000&#8467;. about a horse
for the Derby, and deposited a note in his hand for the purpose.
He told him half the horses were made safe, and that
it was arranged this one was to win. After much delay, and
having got his promise to lay out the money, he told him it
was my horse. He did back the horse for the man for 700&#8467;.,
but the same person told him if my horse <i>could</i> not win Dangerous
would, and he backed the latter likewise for 100&#8467;., by
which his friend was saved, and won 800&#8467;. He did not tell
me his name, nor anything more, except that his object was,
if he had won, to pay his creditors, and he had authorised
Payne to retain the money, if he won it, for that purpose.</p>

<p>We heard, while at the Oaks, that M. Dedel had signed
the convention between France, England, and Holland, on
which all the funds rose. The King of Holland&rsquo;s ratification
was still to be got, and many people will not believe in that
till they see it.</p>

<h3>June 3rd, 1833</h3>

<p>The Government are in high spirits. The
Saints have given in their adhesion to Stanley&rsquo;s plan, and
they expect to carry the West India question. The Bank measure
has satisfied the directors, and most people, except Peel.
The Duke of Wellington told me he was very well satisfied,
but that <i>they</i> had intended to make better terms with the
Bank, and he thought they should have done so. Melbourne
says, &lsquo;Now that we are as much hated as they were, we shall
stay in for ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>As I came into town (having come by the steamboat from
Margate very luxuriously) on Saturday I found a final meeting
at the Council Office to dispose of the lunacy case. It
was so late when Horne finished his reply that I thought
there was no chance of any discussion, and I did not go in;
but I met the Master of the Rolls afterwards, who told me
they had delivered their opinions, Lord Eldon cautiously, he
himself &lsquo;broadly,&rsquo; which I will be bound he did (for he hates
Brougham), and that, though no judgment had been yet
given, the Chancellor&rsquo;s decree would be reversed; so that
after all Brougham&rsquo;s wincing and wriggling to this he has
been forced to submit at last.</p>

<h3>London, June 11th, 1833</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
At a place called Buckhurst all last
week for the Ascot races; a party at Lichfield&rsquo;s, racing all the
morning, then eating and drinking, and play at night.
I may say, with more truth than anybody, &lsquo;Video meliora
proboque, deteriora sequor.&rsquo; The weather was charming, the
course crowded, the King received decently. His household
is now so ill managed that his grooms were drunk every
day, and one man (who was sober) was killed going home
from the races. Goodwin told me nobody exercised any
authority, and the consequence was that the household all
ran riot.</p>

<p>The first day of the races arrived the news that the Duke
of Wellington, after making a strong muster, had beaten
the Government in the House of Lords on the question of
Portuguese neutrality and Don Miguel, that Lord Grey had
announced that he considered it a vote of censure, and threw
out a sort of threat of resigning. He and Brougham (after a
Cabinet) went down to the King. The King was very much
annoyed at this fresh dilemma into which the Tories had
brought him, and consented to whatever Lord Grey required.
In the meantime the House of Commons flew to arms, and
Colonel Dawes gave notice of a motion of confidence in
Ministers upon their foreign policy. This was carried by an
immense majority after a weak debate, in which some very
cowardly menaces were thrown out against the Bishops, and
this settled the question. Ministers did not resign, no Peers
were made, and everything goes on as before. It has been,
however, a disastrous business. How the Duke of Wellington
could take this course after the conversation I had with
him in this room, when he told me he would support the
Government because he wished it to be <i>strong</i>, I can&rsquo;t conceive.
At all events he seems resolved that his Parliamentary
victories should be as injurious as his military
ones were glorious to his country. Some of his friends say
that he was <i>provoked</i> by Lord Grey&rsquo;s supercilious answer to
him the other day, when he said he knew nothing of what
was going on but from what he read in the newspapers,
others that he &lsquo;feels so very strongly&rsquo; about Portugal,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">TORY BLUNDERS.</span>
others that he cannot manage the Tories, and that they
were determined to fight; in short, that he has not the same
authority as leader of a party that he had as general of an
army, for nobody would have forced him to fight the battle
of Salamanca or Vittoria if he had not fancied it himself.
The effect, however, has been this: the House of Lords has
had a rap on the knuckles from the King, their legislative
functions are practically in abeyance, and his Majesty is
more tied than ever to his Ministers. The House of Lords
is paralysed; it exists upon sufferance, and cannot venture
to throw out or materially alter any Bill (such as the India,
Bank, Negro, Church Reform, &amp;c.) which may come up to
it without the certainty of being instantly swamped, and the
measures, however obnoxious, crammed down its throat.
This Government has lost ground in public opinion, they
were daily falling lower, and these predestinated idiots come
and bolster them up just when they most want it. Tavistock
acknowledged to me that they were unpopular, and
that this freak had been of vast service to them; consequently
they are all elated to the greatest degree. The
Tories are sulky and crestfallen; moderate men are vexed,
disappointed, grieved; and the Radicals stand grinning by,
chuckling at the sight of the Conservatives (at least those
who so call themselves, and those who must be so <i>really</i>)
cutting each others&rsquo; throats.</p>

<p>On Saturday, the day after I came back, I found a final
meeting at the Council Office on the lunacy case, the appeal
of Grosvenor against Drax. There were Lord Lansdowne,
the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, Master of the Rolls, Lord
Manners, Lord Eldon, and Lord Lyndhurst. The rule is
that the President of the Council collects the opinions and
votes, beginning with the junior Privy Councillor. This
was the
Chancellor,<a name="FNA_20_09" id="FNA_20_09"></a><a href="#FN_20_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
who made a sort of apology for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
judgment, stating that he had made the order just after two
or three very flagrant cases of a similar description had been
brought under his notice, and then he went into this case,
and endeavoured to show that there was fraud (and intentional
fraud) on the part of the Grosvenors, and he maintained,
without insisting on, and very mildly, his own former
view of the case. Leach then made a speech strongly
against the judgment, and Lord Eldon made a longish
speech, very clear, and very decided against it, interlarded
with professions of his &lsquo;sincere&rsquo; respect for the person who
delivered the judgment. The Chancellor did not reply to
Lord Eldon, but put some questions&mdash;some hypothetical, and
some upon parts of the case itself&mdash;which, together with some
remarks, brought on a discussion between him and Leach,
in which the latter ended by lashing himself into a rage.
&lsquo;My Lord,&rsquo; said he to the Chancellor, &lsquo;we talk too much,
and we don&rsquo;t stick to the point.&rsquo; Brougham put on one of
his scornful smiles, and in reply to something (I forget what)
that the Vice-Chancellor said he dropped in his sarcastic
tone that he would do so and so &lsquo;if his Honour would permit.&rsquo;
For a moment I thought there would be a breeze, but
it ended without any vote, in the adoption of a form of
reversal suggested by Lord Eldon, which left it to the option
of the respondent to institute other proceedings if he should
think fit. Afterwards all was harmony. Eldon seemed
tolerably fresh, feeble, but clear and collected. He was in
spirits about the dinner which had just been given him by
the Templars, at which he was received with extraordinary
honours. He said he hoped never to be called to the Council
Board again, and this was probably the last occasion on
which he will have to appear in a judicial capacity. It is
remarkable that his last act should be to reverse a judgment
of Brougham&rsquo;s, Brougham being Chancellor and himself
nothing. I could not help looking with something like
emotion at this extraordinary old man, and reflecting upon
his long and laborious career, which is terminating gently
and by almost insensible gradations, in a manner more
congenial to a philosophic mind than to an ambitious spirit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">LORD ELDON&rsquo;S GREAT CAREER.</span>
As a statesman and a politician he has survived and witnessed
the ruin of his party and the subversion of those
particular institutions to which he tenaciously clung, and
which his prejudices or his wisdom made him think indispensable
to the existence of the Constitution. As an individual
his destiny has been happier, for he has preserved the
strength of his body and the vigour of his mind far beyond
the ordinary period allotted to man, he is adorned with
honours and blessed with wealth sufficient for the aspirations
of pride and avarice, and while the lapse of time has
silenced the voice of envy, and retirement from office has
mitigated the rancour of political hostility, his great and
acknowledged authority as a luminary of the law shines forth
with purer lustre. He enjoys, perhaps, the most perfect
reward of his long life of labour and study&mdash;a foretaste
of posthumous honour and fame. He has lived to see his
name venerated and his decisions received with profound
respect, and he is departing in peace, with the proud assurance
that he has left to his country a mighty legacy of law
and secured to himself an imperishable fame.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_20_09" id="FN_20_09"></a><a href="#FNA_20_09"><span class="label">[9]</span></a>
[This must be a mistake. The Chancellor takes rank in the Privy
Council after the Lord President and before everyone else. Lord
Brougham was junior Privy Councillor in mere seniority, but his office gave
him rank over the others present. His opinion was probably taken first out
of compliment to him, as he had made the order under review.]</p></div>

<h3>June 15th, 1833</h3>

<p>The day before yesterday I had occasion to
see the Duke of Wellington about the business in which we
are joint trustees, and when we had done I said, &lsquo;Well, that
business in the House of Lords turned out ill the other day.&rsquo;
&lsquo;No; do you think so?&rsquo; he said, and then he went into the
matter. He said that he was compelled to make the motion
by the answer Lord Grey gave to his question a few nights
before; that his party in the House of Lords would not be
satisfied without dividing&mdash;they had been impatient to
attack the Government, and were not to be restrained; that
on the question itself they were <i>right</i>; that so far from his
doing harm to the Government, if they availed themselves
wisely of the defeat they might turn it to account in the
House of Commons, and so far it was of use to them, as it
afforded a convincing proof to their supporters that the
House of Lords might be depended upon for good purposes,
and they might demand of their supporters in the other
House that they should enable them to carry good measures,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
and they keep the House of Commons in harmony with the
House of Lords. He said the Government would make no
Peers, and that they <i>could not</i>; that the Tories were by no
means frightened or disheartened, and meant to take the
first opportunity of showing fight again; in short, he seemed
not dissatisfied with what had already occurred, and resolved
to pursue the same course. He said the Tories were indignant
at the idea of being compelled to keep quiet, and that
if they were to be swamped the sooner it was done the
better, and that they would not give up their right to deal
with any question they thought fit from any motive of expediency
whatever.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know what to make of the Duke and his conduct.
The Catholic question and the Corn Laws and Canning rise
up before me, and make me doubt whether he is so pure in
his views and so free from vindictive feelings as I thought
and hoped he was. When Lords Grey and Brougham went
down to the King after the defeat, they did not talk of
Peers, and only proposed the short answer to the Lords, to
which he consented at once. His Majesty was very indignant
with the Duke, and said it was the second time he had
got him into a scrape, he had made a fool of him last year, and
now wanted to do the same thing again. Some pretend that
all this indignation is simulated; the man is, I believe, more
foolish than false.</p>

<h3>June 19th, 1833</h3>

<p>The King dined with the Duke at his
Waterloo dinner yesterday, which does not look as if he had
been so very angry with him as the Government people say.
The Duke had his windows mended for the occasion, whether
in honour of his Majesty or in consequence of H.B.&rsquo;s caricature
I don&rsquo;t know.</p>

<p>I had a long conversation with Sir Willoughby Cotton
on Sunday about Jamaica affairs. He is Commander-in-Chief,
just come home, and just going out again. He told
me what he had said to Stanley, which was to this effect:
that the compensation would be esteemed munificent, greater
by far than they had expected; that they had looked for a
loan of fifteen millions at two per cent interest, but that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">IRISH CHURCH BILL.</span>
plan would be impracticable, and that sugar could not be
cultivated after slavery ceased; that the slave would never
understand the system of modified servitude by which he
was to be nominally free and actually kept to labour, and
that he would rebel against the magistrate who tried to force
him to work more fiercely than against his master; that the
magistrate would never be able to persuade the slaves in
their new character of apprentices to work as heretofore, and
the military who would be called in to assist them could do
nothing. He asked Stanley if he intended, when the military
were called in, that they should fire on or bayonet the
refractory apprentices. He said no, they were to exhort
them. He gave him to understand that in his opinion they
could do nothing, and that the more the soldiers exhorted
the more the slaves would not work. With regard to my own
particular case he was rather encouraging than not, thought
they would not molest me any
more,<a name="FNA_20_10" id="FNA_20_10"></a><a href="#FN_20_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
that the Assembly
might try and get me out, but that the Council considered
it matter of loyalty to the King not to force out the Clerk of
his Privy Council, but that if anything more was said about
it, and I went out to Jamaica, I might be sure of getting
leave again in a month or six weeks.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="FN_20_10" id="FN_20_10"></a><a href="#FNA_20_10"><span class="label">[20]</span></a>
[This refers to Mr. Greville&rsquo;s holding the office of Secretary of the
Island of Jamaica with permanent leave of absence. The work of the office
was done by a deputy, who was paid by a share of the emoluments which
were in the shape of fees.]</p></div>

<h3>June 26th, 1833</h3>

<p>This morning at six saw my mother and
Henry start for the steamboat which is to take them abroad.
I wish I was going with them, and was destined once more
to see Rome and Naples, which I fear will never be. Last
week was marked by a division in the House of Commons
which made a great noise. It was on that clause of the
Irish Church Bill which declared that the surplus should
be appropriated by Parliament, and Stanley thought fit to
leave out the clause. The Tories supported him; the
Radicals and many of the Whigs&mdash;Abercromby and C.
Russell among the number&mdash;opposed him. The minority
was strong&mdash;148&mdash;but the fury it excited among many of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
friends of Government is incredible, and the Tories were
very triumphant without being at all conciliated. The
Speaker said he should not be surprised to see the Bill
thrown out by the junction of the Tories and Radicals on
the third reading, which is not likely, and the suppression of
this clause, which after all leaves the matter just as it was,
will probably carry it through the House of Lords. It is,
however, very questionable whether they were right in withdrawing
it, and Tavistock told me that though he thought
it was <i>right</i> it was ill done, and had given great offence.
Somehow or other Stanley, with all his talents, makes a mess
of everything, but this comes of being (what the violent
Whigs suspect him of being) half a Tory. Measures are
concocted upon ultra principles in the Cabinet, and then as
his influence is exerted, and his wishes are obliged to be
consulted, they are modified and altered, and this gives a
character of vacillation to the conduct of Government, and
exhibits a degree of weakness and infirmity of purpose which
prevents their being strong or popular or respectable. Nobody,
however, can say that they are obstinate, for they are
eternally giving way to somebody. In the House of Lords
there was a sharp skirmish between Brougham and Lyndhurst,
and high Parliamentary words passed between these
&lsquo;noble friends&rsquo; on the Local Courts Bill. The Tories did
not go down to support Lyndhurst, which provoked him, and
Brougham was nettled by his and old Eldon&rsquo;s attacks on the
Bill.</p>

<p>There is great talk of a letter which the King is said to
have written to the bishops&mdash;that is, to the Archbishop for
the edification of the episcopal bench. It is hardly credible
that he and Taylor should have been guilty of this folly,
after the letter which they wrote to the Peers a year and a
half ago and the stir that it made.</p>

<p>I have got from Sir Henry Lushington Monk Lewis&rsquo;s
journals and his two voyages to the West Indies (one of
which I read at Naples), with liberty to publish them, which
I mean to do if I can get money enough for him. He says
Murray offered him 500&#8467;. for the manuscripts some years
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
<span class="pagehead">THE KING WRITES TO THE ARCHBISHOP.</span>
ago. I doubt getting so much now, but they are uncommonly
amusing, and it is the right moment for publishing
them now that people are full of interest about the West
India question. I was very well amused last week at the
bazaar in Hanover Square, when a sale was held on four
successive days by the fine ladies for the benefit of the
foreigners in distress. It was like a masquerade without
masks, for everybody&mdash;men, women, and children&mdash;roved
about where they would, everybody talking to everybody,
and vast familiarity established between perfect strangers
under the guise of barter. The Queen&rsquo;s stall was held by
Ladies Howe and Denbigh, with her three prettiest maids of
honour, Miss Bagot dressed like a soubrette and looking
like an angel. They sold all sorts of trash at enormous
prices, and made, I believe, four or five thousand pounds. I
went on Monday to hear Lushington speak in the cause of
Swift and Kelly. He spoke for three hours&mdash;an excellent
speech. I sat by Mr. Swift all the time; he is not ill-looking,
but I should think vulgar, and I&rsquo;m sure impudent,
for the more Lushington abused him the more he
laughed.</p>

<h3>June 28th, 1833</h3>

<p>The King did write to the Archbishop of
Canterbury a severe reproof to be communicated to the
bishops for having voted against his Government upon a
question purely political (the Portuguese), in which the
interests of the Church were in no way concerned. He sent
a copy of the letter to Lord Grey, and Brougham told
Sefton and Wharncliffe the contents, both of whom told me.
It is remarkable that nothing has been said upon the subject
in the House of Lords. The Archbishop, the most timid of
mankind, had the prudence (I am told) to abstain from communicating
the letter to the bishops, and held a long consultation
with the Archbishop of York as to the mode of
dealing with this puzzling document. If he had communicated
it, he would as a Privy Councillor have been responsible
for it, but what answer he made to the King I know
not. Never was there such a proceeding, so unconstitutional,
so foolish; but his Ministers do not seem to mind it, and are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
rather elated at such a signal proof of his disposition to support
them. I think, as far as being a discouragement to
the Tories, and putting an end to their notion that he is
hankering after them, it may be of use, and it is probably
true that he does not wish for a change, but on the contrary
dreads it. He naturally dreads whatever is likely to raise a
storm about his ears and interrupt his repose.</p>

<p>Lyndhurst is in such a rage at his defeat in the House
of Lords on the Local Courts Bill that he swore at first he
would never come there again. What he said&mdash;that &lsquo;if they
had considered it a party question the result would have
been very different,&rsquo; which Brougham unaccountably took for
a threat against the Government&mdash;was levelled at his own
Tory friends for not supporting him. On the third reading
they mean to have another fight about it. I understand the
lawyers that the Bill is very objectionable, and calculated to
degrade the profession. I sat by Talleyrand at dinner the day
before yesterday, who told me a good deal about Mirabeau,
but as he had a bad cold, in addition to his usual mode of
pumping up his words from the bottomest pit of his stomach,
it was next to impossible to understand him. He said
Mirabeau was really intimate with three people only&mdash;himself,
Narbonne, and Lauzun&mdash;that Auguste d&rsquo;Aremberg was
the negotiator of the Court and medium of its communications
with Mirabeau; that he had found (during the provisional
Government) a receipt of Mirabeau&rsquo;s for a million,
which he had given to Louis XVIII.</p>
